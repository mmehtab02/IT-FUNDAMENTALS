Q1. What is one of the most common methods of connecting peripherals to computers? Ans: UNIVERSAL SERIAL BUS (USB)

Q2. One of the early versions of USB was________, and it had ______different speeds.
Ans. USB 1.1
TWO DIFFERENT SPEEDS

Q3. The early versions of USB had a low speed, which was _________megabits per second and a maximum cable length of around ________ meters.
Ans. 1.5 MEGABITS PER SECOND
3 METERS

FULL SPEED 12 MEGABITS PER SECOND OVER 5 METERS.

Q4. What is the maximum speed of USB 2.0?
Ans: 480 MEGABITS/SECOND OVER 5 METERS.

Q5. What is USB 3.0?
Ans: AN UPGRADE TO USB 2.0, ALSO REFERRED TO AS SUPERSPEED USB.
IT SUPPORTS 5 GIGABITS PER SECOND AND DOESN’T SPECIFY A CABLE LENGTH BUT 3 METERS IS COMMON

Q6. What are some common connectors from the USB 1.1 and 2.0 versions?
Ans: STANDARD-A PLUG (VERY COMMON)
STANDARD-B PLUG (MORE WIDTH LESS LENGTH)
MINI-B PLUG (BIGGER THAN MICRO-B)
MICRO-B PLUG (TYPICALLY CALLED ANDROID CABLE)

Q7. The USB 3.0 micro-B plug is very different from the USB 2.0 version.(T/F)
Ans. TRUE

Q8. What is the USB-C connector?
Ans: IT IS THE NEW CONNECTOR THAT REPLACES ALL OF THE PREVIOUS ONES THAT WERE ANNOYING TO CONNECT.
USB C DESCRIBES THE CONNECTOR ITSELF AND NOT THE TYPE OF SIGNAL YOU ARE SENDING OVER THE CONNECTOR.
YOU CAN SEND MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONNECTIONS OVER USB C.
Q9. What is the maximum speed of USB 3.0?
Ans: 5 GIGABITS PER SECOND

Q10. How does USB 3.2 improve bandwidth?
Ans: IT DOUBLES THE BANDWIDTH IN USB WITH THE USB-C CABLES.
THERE’S AN EXTRA LANE OF COMMUNICATION INSIDE THE CABLE TO PROVIDE THAT ENHANCED THROUGHPUT.

Q11. What is the size of the USB-C connector?
Ans: NOT MUCH LARGER THAN THE MICRO-B (FAIRLY SMALL)
IT IS ALSO SYMMETRIC IN SHAPE.


Q12. What is the name of the USB 3.0 connection type?
Ans: SUPERSPEED

Q13. What is an update of USB 3.0?
Ans. USB 3.1 GEN 1

Q14. What is the latest version of USB released in 2017?
Ans: USB 3.2

Q15.The standard that used to be USB 3.0, which we change to _______Gen 1 is now called ______Gen 1 or superspeed USB __gigabits per second.
Ans.
USB 3.1
USB 3.2
SUPERSPEED USB 5 GIGABITS/SEC

USB 3.1 → USB 3.1 GEN 2 → USB 3.2 GEN 2
SUPERSPEED USB 10 GBPS

Q16. What is the maximum throughput of USB 3.2 Gen 2 times 2?
 Ans: SUPERSPEED USB 20 GBPS USING 2 “GEN 2” LANES
USB 3.2 GEN 2X2

Q17. What is Thunderbolt?
Ans: HIGH-SPEED SERIAL CONNECTOR THAT CAN PUT DATA AND POWER ON THE SAME CABLE.
IT IS BASED ON THE MINI DISPLAYPORT (MDP) STANDARD PHYSICAL CONNECTORS.

Ans. COPPER
FIBER

Q21. What is the maximum length of a Thunderbolt connection?
Ans: COPPER = 3 METERS
FIBER = 60 METERS

Q22. How many Thunderbolt devices can be daisy-chained together?
Ans: SIX

Q23. Before we had a universal serial bus, we were using _____ pin and ____ pin serial connections on our computers to be able to connect peripherals.
Ans. 9 PIN
25 PIN

Q24. What type of connectors were used before the invention of the Universal Serial Bus?
Ans: DB 9 / DB 25
D-SUBMINIATURE CONNECTORS
RS-232 SERIAL SIGNALS
