Q1. What type of cable is commonly used for ethernet networks?
Ans: TWISTED PAIR COPPER CABLING

Q2. What does an ethernet cable look like inside?
Ans: 4 PAIRS OF WIRES INSIDE THE CABLE WITH DIFFERENT COLORS.
ONE PAIR IS SOLID BLUE, BLUE AND WHITE.
ONE PAIR IS SOLID GREEN, GREEN AND WHITE.
ONE PAIR IS SOLID ORANGE, ORANGE AND WHITE.
ONE PAIR IS SOLID BROWN, BROWN AND WHITE.


Q3. What is the purpose of twisting the wires in a pair?
Ans: BALANCED PAIR OPERATION - THESE PAIRS OF WIRED CONTAIN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE SIGNALS TO EACH OTHER AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS TRANSMIT+, TRANSMIT- / RECEIVE+, RECEIVE- TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE SENDING OPPOSITE SIGNALS FROM EACHOTHER.

THE TWIST ALLOWS TO KEEP A SINGLE WIRE CONSTANTLY MOVING AWAY FROM INTERFERENCE AND THE OPPOSITE SIGNALS ARE COMPARED ON THE OTHER END.


Q4. What is the purpose of having two cables?
Ans: WE COMBINE THIS DIFFERENCE IN SIGNAL WITH A TWISTED CABLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS INFORMATION FROM ONE SIDE OF THE NETWORK TO THE OTHER.

THESE PAIRS HAVE TWISTS IN THEM AND THAT MEANS THE SIGNAL GOING THROUGH THIS WIRE IS CONSTANTLY TWISTING AS WELL AND MOVING AWAY FROM ANY TYPE OF INTERFERENCE AS IT’S MOVING THROUGH THE CABLE.

WHEN THE SIGNALS ARRIVE AT THE OTHER END, THE SIGNALS ARE COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER AND ANY INTERFERENCE THAT OCCURS IN THE WIRES CAN BE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE OF THE 2 CABLES WITH DIFFERENT SIGNALS TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE.

Q5. Why are the four pairs of wires different?
Ans. THE CABLE PAIRS HAVE DIFFERENT TWIST RATES SO THERE MAY BE A TIGHTER TWIST ON ONE PAIR OF WIRES THAN ANOTHER PAIR.
ALL 4 OF THESE PAIRS WILL HAVE DIFFERENT SIGNALS ON THE OTHER END BECAUSE OF THESE TWIST RATES.

Q6. What is twisted pair cabling?
Ans: CABLES THAT RUN OFF THIS DESIGN OF TWISTED PAIR WIRES INSIDE OF THE CABLE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TWISTED PAIR CABLES. EACH OF THESE HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SUPPORTS DIFFERENT KINDS OF NETWORKS.

THESE ARE REFERRED TO AS CATEGORIES OF CABLES.

Q7. : How many different types of twisted pair cabling are there?
Ans: FOUR

Q8. What do we refer to the different types of twisted pair cables as?
Ans: CATEGORIES OF CABLES

Q9. What is 1000BASE-T?
Ans: 1 GIGABIT / SECOND ETHERNET STANDARD THAT OPERATES ON TWISTED PAIR COPPER CABLING.

Q10. : What is the maximum distance of 1000BASE-T?
Ans: 100 METERS

Q11. What type of cable is used for 1000BASE-T?
Ans: TWISTED PAIR COPPER CABLING
CATEGORY 5 AND CATEGORY 5E (ENHANCED) CABLE CATEGORIES.


Q12. What is 10GBASE-T?
Ans: 10 GIGABIT / SECOND ETHERNET STANDARD THAT OPERATES ON TWISTED PAIR COPPER CABLING.


Q13. What does the "E" stand for in Category 5e?
Ans: ENHANCED

Q14. What type of cabling is available to purchase today?
Ans: CATEGORY 5E (CAT5 MAY EXIST IN OLDER INFRASTRUCTURES FROM THE PAST)

Q15. What type of cabling is commonly used in existing network infrastructures?
Ans: CATEGORY 5 (PAST)

Q16. What type of cabling does 1000BASE-T support?
Ans: TWISTED PAIR COPPER CABLING
CATEGORY 6 AND CATEGORY 6A (AUGMENTED) CABLE CATEGORIES.


Q17. Is there an augmented version of category 6?
Ans: YES

Q18. What type of cable is commonly used with cable modem networks?
Ans: COAXIAL CABLE

Q19. What is the conductor of a coaxial cable?
Ans: TWO OR MORE FORMS SHARE A COMMON AXIS (WIRE CONDUCTOR BEING THE AXIS RUNNING THE LINK OF THE COAX CABLE)

Q20. What is the most commonly used type of coax cable?
Ans: RG-6 - USED IN TELEVISION / DIGITAL CABLE (AND HIGH-SPEED INTERNET OVER THIS CABLE)

Q21. What is the construction of a coax cable?
Ans: YOU HAVE THE WIRE CONDUCTOR AS THE AXIS, A DIELECTRIC INSULATOR SURROUNDING THE WIRE CONDUCTOR, METAL SHIELDING AROUND THE INSULATOR, AND A PLASTIC JACKET ON THE OUTERMOST LAYER.


Q22. What is the plenum?
Ans: THE AREA IN A DROP CEILING WHERE DUCTS SUPPLY COLD AIR AND REMOVE WARM AIR BUT INSTEAD OF SENDING WARM AIR INTO DUCTS AS A FORCED AIR-RETURN, IT SENDS THIS WARM AIR / AIR RETURN INTO A SHARED AIRSPACE CALLED THE PLENUM.

IT IS ALSO CALLED ACTIVE / CIRCULATING PLENUM AIRSPACE AND THIS IS A SHARED AREA WHERE WE MIGHT RUN OUR NETWORK CABLES.

Q23. What is the purpose of the plenum?
Ans: THIS PLENUM SPACE COULD BE USED FOR AIR CIRCULATION OF THE WARM AIR IN AN HEATING / AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM, AND IT CAN ALSO BE USED AS SPACE TO RUN OUR NETWORKING CABLING SYSTEM.

THERE NEEDS TO BE PLANNING FOR OUR NETWORK CABLES TO NOT CREATE TOXIC AIR / FUMES / SMOKE IN THE CASE OF FIRES.

FOR THIS WE HAVE SPECIAL TYPES OF NETWORK CABLES THAT DON’T CREATE THESE PROBLEMS.

Q24. What type of cable should be used in a shared plenum area?
Ans: FIRE-RATED / PLENUM-RATED CABLE JACKET MATERIAL.
FLUORINATED ETHYLENE POLYMER (FEP) OR LOW-SMOKE POLYVINYL CHLORIDE (PVC).


Q25. What is the jacket of an ethernet cable typically made of?
Ans: POLYVINYL CHLORIDE (PVC).
THIS IS THE TRADITIONAL CABLE JACKET MATERIAL.



Q26. What type of cable is usually used for cable runs?
Ans: UNSHIELDED TWISTED PAIR (UTP)
THIS DOESN’T HAVE ANY SPECIAL SHIELDING AROUND THE CABLES THEMSELVES OR THE INDIVIDUAL WIRES IN THE CABLE.
COMMON IN HOME ENVIRONMENTS.
THE MOST COMMON TWISTED PAIR CABLING.

Q27. What is STP?
Ans: SHIELDED TWISTED PAIRS - ADDITIONAL SHIELDING PROTECTION FOR THE CABLE, AND PROTECTION AGAINST INTERFERENCE.
EACH PAIR AND/OR THE CABLE IS SHIELDED.
COULD ALSO HAVE A GROUNDING WIRE ALONGSIDE THE PAIRED WIRES FOR ADDITIONAL PROTECTION.


Q28. What type of writing is found on the outside of an ethernet cable?
Ans: ABBREVIATIONS TO DESCRIBE THE CABLE SUCH AS :
U
S
F
USUALLY THESE ARE WRITTEN WITH A LETTER, A SLASH, ANOTHER LETTER, THEN FP :
(OVERALL CABLE) / (INDIVIDUAL PAIRS)TP

Q29. What do the abbreviations stand for?
Ans: U - UNSHIELDED
S - BRAIDED SHIELDING
F - FOIL SHIELDING
TP - TWISTED PAIR

Q30. What does S/FTP stand for?
Ans: BRAIDED SHIELDING FOIL SHIELDED TWISTED PAIR

IN THIS CASE, THERE IS BRAIDED SHIELDING (S) AROUND THE ENTIRE CABLE, THERE IS FOIL (F) AROUND THE PAIRS, AND IT IS A TWISTED PAIR CABLE (TP)

S/FTP

Q31. What does F/UTP stand for?
Ans: FOIL SHIELDING UNSHIELDED TWISTED PAIR

IN THIS CASE, THERE IS FOIL (F) AROUND THE CABLE, NO SHIELDING (U) AROUND THE PAIR, AND IT IS A TWISTED PAIR CABLE (TP)

F/UTP


Q32. What type of cable is used for direct burial?
Ans: DIRECT BURIAL (STP) SHIELDED TWISTED PAIR.

THESE CABLES ARE BURIED DIRECTLY IN THE GROUND (TYPICALLY OUTSIDE) IN SOME CASE WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF CONDUIT.

Q33. What is used to waterproof the cables?
Ans: THESE DIRECT BURIAL STP CABLES ARE DESIGNED FOR OUTSIDE, THEREFORE THEY HAVE WATERPROOFING INSIDE OF THEM.

SOMETIMES THEY ARE FILLED WITH GEL TO REPEL WATER AWAY FROM THE INSIDE CABLE.

THIS ALLOWS YOU TO RUN THE CABLE DIRECTLY IN THE GROUND WITHOUT THE USE OF A CONDUIT.



Q34. What purpose does the shielding serve?
Ans: THESE CABLES ARE USUALLY SHIELDED TWISTED PAIR WHICH PREVENTS SIGNAL INTERFERENCE, AND ADDS STRENGTH AND GROUNDING TO THE CABLE ITSELF.
