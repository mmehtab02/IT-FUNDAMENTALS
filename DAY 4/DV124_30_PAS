Q6. So although you may find motherboards and other equipment that are referring to an ATA drive or an IDE connection, today we refer to all of these as__________.
Ans.  PARALLEL ATA OR PATA

Q7. What type of connection is on one end of the PATA cables?
Ans: 40 PIN CONNECTOR FOR THE MOTHERBOARD.

Q8. How many 40 pin connectors are on each cable?
Ans: 1 SET ON THE MOTHERBOARD CONNECTION SIDE, 2 MORE SETS ON THE OTHER END OF THE CABLE.

Q9. How is the device order different on the 80 wire cable?
Ans: THE FIRST INTERFACE IS DEVICE 1 INSTEAD OF DEVICE 0, AND THE LAST INTERFACE ON THE END OF THE CABLE IS DEVICE 0 INSTEAD OF DEVICE 1.

COMPARED TO THE 40-WIRE CABLE (ORIGINAL PATA CABLE)

Q10. What was the original PATA cable?
Ans: 40 WIRE PATA CABLE

Q11. How did they decrease crosstalk between wires?
Ans: BY DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF WIRES FROM 40 TO 80 BECAUSE THE CROSSTALK INCREASED WHEN SPEEDS INCREASED FOR PATA.

Q12. How does an 80 wire cable differ from a 40 wire cable?
Ans: THEY ARE FOR NEWER (HIGHER SPEED) PATA CABLES TO MINIMIZE CROSSTALK.

THEY HAVE DOUBLE THE WIRES COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL 40 WIRE PATA CABLE.

THE INTERFACE NUMBERS ARE SWAPPED COMPARED TO THE 40 WIRE PATA.

Q13. The size of the PATA connector compared to the SATA connectors is large. (True/False)
Ans. TRUE

Q14. What is the purpose of the missing pin in the motherboard's PATA connector?
Ans: SINCE THE 40 PIN CONNECTOR IS SYMMETRICAL, THE MISSING PIN ALLOWS US TO PROPERLY ORIENT THE CABLE INTO THE RIGHT FORMAT WHEN PLUGGING INTO THE CONNECTOR.

Q15. What do you need to look at to understand how a PATA cable works?
Ans: LOOK AT THE END OF THE CABLE AND THE MOTHERBOARD INTERFACE. YOU WILL NOTICE MISSING HOLES AND PINS RESPECTIVELY, AND A NOTCH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE INTERFACE AND CONNECTORS.

Q16. What is the purpose of the notch on a PATA cable?
Ans: THIS ALSO HELPS WHEN ORIENTING THE CABLE.



Q17. What type of connector is used for storage devices?
Ans: A 40 PIN SYMMETRICAL CONNECTOR THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE ONE YOU FIND ON A MOTHERBOARD WITH PINS, ONE PIN MISSING, AND A MISSING NOTCH PLACEMENT.
