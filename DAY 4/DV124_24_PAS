Q1. What are the benefits of using ethernet over optical fiber as opposed to twisted pair copper cabling?
Ans: WE CAN SEND DATA TRANSMISSION OVER VERY LONG DISTANCES. IT IS DONE BY TRANSMITTING DATA BY LIGHT.

Q2. What do you mean by transmission by light?
Ans. SENDING LIGHT SIGNALS OVER THE FIBER CABLE FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER.

Q3. Another characteristic of fiber optic communication is because we’re sending light signals, there’s no ______________.
Ans. RADIO FREQUENCIES
ALLOWS A SECURITY LAYER AS WELL SINCE THE RF CANNOT BE INTERCEPTED.

Q4.What is the advantage of using fiber optics for communication?
Ans: TRANSMISSION OVER LONG DISTANCE, NO RF THEREFORE LESS SECURITY RISKS

Q5. Radio frequencies tend to have a larger distance than fiber optics. (T/F)
Ans. FALSE

Q6. What if there’s any radio frequencies in your immediate area, then what is the impact on Fiber optics?
Ans. THERE WILL BE NO IMPACT ON YOUR FIBER OPTIC SIGNAL. IT IS IMMUNE TO RADIO INTERFERENCE.

Q7. What does the fiber optic connection look like?
Ans: FIBER CABLE IS VERY SMALL COMPARED TO A COPPER CABLE.
THE ACTUAL FIBER IS A SMALL DOT ON THE END OF THE FERRULE ON THE END OF THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE.
THE FIBER IS PROTECTED BY A BUFFER COATING ON THE OUTER LAYER, AND BETWEEN THE COATING AND THE FIBER IS A LOW REFLECTIVE INDEX CLADDING.
THE FIBER IS CONSIDERED THE CORE.

Q8. What is the purpose of the buffer coating in a fiber optic cable?
Ans: THIS PROTECTS EVERYTHING THAT’S ON THE INSIDE OF THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE.

Q9. What is the purpose of the cladding surrounding the core in fiber optics?
Ans: THE CLADDING HAS A LOW REFLECTIVE INDEX WHICH MEANS ANY LIGHT THAT HAPPENS TO HIT THE CLADDING IS ABSORBED BY THE CLADDING INSTEAD OF BEING REFLECTED BACK IN THROUGH THE CORE.

Q10. What is usually found at the end of a fiber optic connection?
Ans: A FERRULE (LARGE CERAMIC PROTECTOR)
INSIDE THE FERRULE IS THE CORE.

Q11. What are two broad categories of fiber optics?
Ans. MULTI-MODE AND SINGLE-MODE FIBER.

Q12. What type of fiber optic cable is commonly used for large range communication? Ans: SINGLE-MODE FIBER
UP TO 100KM
COMMONLY USES LASERS (EXPENSIVE LIGHT SOURCE)

Q13. Each networking standard has its own set of maximum distances that you can use, depending on what type of____________you’re using.
Ans. CABLING

Q14. What type of light source is commonly used with multi-mode fiber?
Ans: LEDS (RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE LIGHT SOURCE ASSOCIATED WITH MULTI-MODE FIBER)

Q15. What type of fiber optic cable is commonly used for short range communication?
Ans. MULTI-MODE FIBER
UP TO 2KM
