Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. What does SCSI stand for?
Ans SMALL COMPUTER SYSTEMS INTERFACE

Q2. What is a SCSI interface?
Q3. What was the purpose of creating the SCSI interface?
Q4. How many devices can be connected to one SCSI chain?
-
Ans: STANDARD INTERFACE THAT CAN BE USED TO CONNECT TO STORAGE DEVICES, SCANNERS, PRINTERS, ETC. ON YOUR NETWORK.

IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE MANY DEVICES CONNECTED TO ONE SINGLE INTERFACE ON YOUR COMPUTER BY DAISY CHAINING MULTIPLE DEVICES TOGETHER.

MANY OF THE SCSI STANDARDS SUPPORT UP TO 16 DEVICES IN ONE OF THESE SCSI CHAINS.

INTERFACE DESIGNED TO STRING MULTIPLE PERIPHERALS ONTO A SINGLE CABLE / CONTROLLER.
-
Q5. What is the newest SCSI standard?
Ans: iSCSI (SCSI OVER IP)

Q6. What types of connectivity does SCSI support?
Ans: PARALLEL AND SERIAL OPTIONS (PATA, SATA) DEPENDING ON THE DIFFERENT FORMATS / STANDARDS IN USE.

Q7. How many devices could a single SCSI interface support on a narrow bus?
Ans: 8 DIFFERENT SCSI DEVICES ON A NARROW BUS
16 ON A WIDE BUS VERSION

Q8. What was used to connect our scanners and CD-ROM drives before SATA and USB?
Ans: BEFORE THE SATA AND USB STANDARDS, WE USED SCSI.

Q9. What is one of the benefits of SCSI and its protocols?
Ans: IT IS A VERY INTELLIGENT FORM OF CONNECTIVITY. YOU PROVIDE BASIC CONNECTIVITY AND THE SCSI TAKES CARE OF IDENTIFYING WHAT DEVICES ARE IN THAT CHAIN AND HOW TO ACCESS THOSE DEVICES OVER THE SCSI CONNECTION.

INTELLIGENT INTERFACE FUNCTIONALITY - DIFFICULT CONFIGURATION WORK IS DONE BETWEEN THE SCSI DEVICES.

Q10. Are SCSI protocols still used today?
Ans: YES YOU MAY STILL FIND SYSTEMS THAT HAVE SCSI DRIVES OR OTHER TYPES OF SCSI CONNECTIVITY.
IT IS ALSO USED EXTENSIVELY ON OUR VIRTUAL SYSTEMS.

INDUSTRY LONGEVITY - WELL SUPPORTED IN THE ENTERPRISE. A STANDARD DRIVE FOR VIRTUAL SYSTEMS.

Q11. What is the 68 pin connector commonly used for?
Ans: THE ULTRA 3 INTERFACE HAS 68 PINS ON THE EXAMPLE’S CONNECTOR. IT IS USED FOR THE 68 PIN SCSI CABLE TO CONNECT TO THE MOTHERBOARD’S INTERFACE.


Q12. What is the purpose of having a single interface on a computer?
Ans: YOU NEED SOME WAY TO BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ALL OF THESE SEPERATE DEVICES THAT YOU ARE CONNECTING TO USING THE SAME CABLE.

MULTIPLE INTERFACES WOULD MAKE IT HARD TO CONNECT AND MANAGE SINCE THE SCSI DESIGN AND INTELLIGENCE HANDLES THIS.

Q13. What is the purpose of a SCSI ID?
Ans: THE SCSI ID HELPS DIFFERENTIATE THE DEVICES ON THIS CABLE CONNECTION.
FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR COMPUTER MIGHT BE SCSI ID 0 (SCSI CONTROLLER), YOUR HARD DRIVE MIGHT BE SCSI ID 2, YOUR CD-ROM MIGHT BE SCSI ID 3.

Q14. How does SCSI allow for connectivity to a drive array?
Ans: THE CHASSIS OF THE DRIVE ARRAY CAN BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A SCSI ID, AND THE INDIVIDUAL DRIVES CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY A LOGICAL UNIT (LUN).

SAME APPLIES IF YOU USE A VIRTUAL MACHINE.

Q15. What is the purpose of a SCSI terminator?
Ans: THE TERMINATOR AT THE END OF THE CABLE ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE DEVICES ON THIS WIRE TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE ACROSS ALL OF THOSE DEVICES SIMULTANEOUSLY.

THE SIGNAL AT THE “END” OF A PHYSICAL SCSI BUS IS TERMINATED.

Q16. What is a logical unit?
Ans: A LOGICAL UNIT ALLOWS YOU TO REFER TO A SINGLE DRIVE (DEVICE) WITHIN A MUCH LARGER SCSI DEVICE.

Q17. What is a newer SCSI standard?
Ans: SERIAL ATTACHED SCSI (SAS)

Q18. Is there anything required to use a SAS device?
Ans: NO, YOU DON’T NEED TO MANUALLY SET SCSI IDS OR ALWAYS HAVE A TERMINATOR ON THE CONNECTION.

YOU DON’T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT SETTING JUMPERS FOR THE SCSI IDS AND YOU DON’T HAVE TO INSTALL ANY TERMINATORS OR MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL SETTINGS TO BE ABLE TO USE THOSE SAS DEVICES.

SAS DEVICES HAVE NO JUMPERS, TERMINATORS, OR SETTINGS.

Q19. What can be seen on the back of an external SCSI storage device?
Ans: POWER INTERFACE, A FAN / COOLING, AND SCSI INTERFACES (SCSI OUT, SCSI IN) THAT ALLOW YOU TO DAISY CHAIN THIS DEVICE AND OTHER DEVICES ON THE SAME CABLE.

Q20. Are there any buttons to modify the SCSI ID?
Ans: YES

Q21. What does a SCSI controller look like when you look inside a computer?
Ans: THE CONTROLLER HAS CABLES FROM IT RUNNING TO THE OTHER DRIVES / DEVICES THAT COULD BE DAISY CHAINED TOGETHER.

Q22. What does the SCSI terminator look like?
Ans: A SMALL TERMINATOR DEVICE AT THE END OF THE SCSI CABLE.

Q23. What replaced the need for cables with multiple interfaces and devices with multiple SCSI interfaces?
Ans: PATA → SATA (EXAMPLE)

PARALLEL SCSI TO SERIAL ATTACHED SCSI (SAS) (SIMILAR MOVE).

POINT TO POINT CONNECTION BETWEEN MOTHERBOARD AND DRIVE.

NO MORE DAISY CHAINS.

NO TERMINATION REQUIRED.

INCREASED THROUGHPUT.

BETTER CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF SCSI.

SPEED OF SERIAL CONNECTION.
