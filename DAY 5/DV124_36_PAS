36_SAS_On RAID
Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. What is used to store large amounts of information?
Ans: HARD DRIVES (HDD)

Q2. What can happen to hard drives eventually?
Ans: MECHANICAL FAILURES

Q3. What can be done to ensure data remains available if a drive fails?
Ans: RAID ARRAY CONFIGURATION FOR DATA REDUNDANCY.

Q4. What is RAID?
Ans: USE MULTIPLE STORAGE DRIVES IN A SYSTEM THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAINTAIN UPTIME AND AVAILABILITY IF ONE OF THOSE DRIVES HAPPEN TO FAIL.

RAID IS NOT A COPY OF YOUR DATA / BACKUP, IT IS THE DATA THAT YOU ARE ACTIVELY RETRIEVING OR STORING TO MAINTAIN UPTIME AND AVAILABILITY IF A DRIVE FAILS.

Q5. What does RAID stand for?
Ans: REDUNDANT ARRAY OF INDEPENDENT DISKS


Q6. What is the difference between earlier versions of RAID and the current version?
Ans: THEY USE THE WORD INEXPENSIVE DISKS INSTEAD OF INDEPENDENT.

Q7. Do all RAID levels provide redundancy?
Ans: NO

Q8. We referred to different types of RAID as ____________.
Ans. RAID LEVELS

Q9. What is RAID 0 or striping?
Ans: WE HAVE AT LEAST 2 DRIVES IN A RAID 0 ARRAY.
INSTEAD OF WRITING EVERYTHING TO ONE DRIVE OR THE OTHER, WE TAKE OUR DATA AND SPLIT IT EVENLY BETWEEN THESE 2 DRIVES.

BLOCKS OF DATA HOP BACK AND FORTH ON DIFFERENT DRIVES.

Q10. What is the benefit of splitting a single file across multiple drives?
Ans: DISTRIBUTING BLOCKS OF DATA ACROSS MULTIPLE DRIVES PROVIDES A PERFORMANCE INCREASE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE TO WRITE / READ HALF OF THE DATA IF WE HAVE 2 SEPERATE DRIVES.

HIGH PERFORMANCE.

Q11. What is the problem with RAID 0?
Ans: IF WE LOSE ONE OF THESE DRIVES, NONE OF THE DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE LOST HALF OF THE DATA YOU’VE STORED.

THERE IS NO REDUNDANCY.

Q12. How is RAID 1 different from RAID 0?
Ans: IT IS SIMILAR IN STRUCTURE WITH (AT LEAST) 2 DISKS.

WE ARE DUPLICATING DATA BETWEEN BOTH THESE DRIVES. EACH DRIVE IS A MIRROR IMAGE OF THE OTHER.

RAID 1 IS REFERRED TO AS MIRRORING.

Q13. What is the benefit of having duplicate drives?
Ans: IF WE LOSE EITHER DRIVE’S DATA, IT REMAINS AS A DUPLICATE ON THE OTHER DRIVE.

HIGH REDUNDANCY.

Q14. What is the consequence of having duplicate drives?
Ans: YOU NEED TWICE AS MUCH STORAGE TO BE ABLE TO STORE THE SAME AMOUNT OF INFORMATION.

HIGH DISK UTILIZATION.

Q15. : What is RAID 5?
Ans: ANOTHER RAID METHOD CALLED STRIPING WITH PARITY.





Q16. How does RAID 5 work?
Q17. What is the purpose of RAID 5?


-
Ans: IT IS THE SAME AS RAID 0 WHERE WE STORE PIECES OF DATA ACROSS DIFFERENT DRIVES.

WE ALSO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL DRIVE WHERE WE STORE SOME PARITY INFORMATION.

THIS ALLOWS US TO REBUILD THE DATA IF WE HAPPEN TO LOSE ANY OF THESE PHYSICAL DRIVES.

THIS IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT USE OF DRIVE SPACE BECAUSE IT IS SPREAD ACROSS DRIVES AND ONE ADDITIONAL DRIVE HAS PARITY INFORMATION.

YOU CAN ALSO DISTRIBUTE PARITY TO DIFFERENT DRIVES WHICH HELPS DURING THE RECOVERY PROCESS, WHICH IS IMPORTANT WHEN A SINGLE DRIVE FAILS IN THE RAID 5 ARRAY.

THIS IS OBVIOUSLY DATA REDUNDANCY WITH THE RAID ARRAYS.
-
Q18. What happens if a single drive is lost in a RAID system?
Ans: SOME OF THE DATA IS LOST, BUT IT CAN BE REBUILT IN REAL TIME BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PARITY INFORMATION STORED SEPARATELY.

THIS CAN TAKE A PERFORMANCE HIT ON THE CPU CYCLES THAT WORK WITH THE PARITY, BUT WITH PROPER PROCESSING ON THE RAID CONTROLLER OR THE PROPER CPU INSIDE YOUR SYSTEM, YOU MAY NOT EVEN SEE THAT PERFORMANCE ISSUE OCCURRING.
-
BENEFITS : HIGH REDUNDANCY, EFFICIENT USE OF DISK SPACE
CONS : MAY AFFECT PERFORMANCE TO REBUILD FROM PARITY.

Q19. What is RAID 10?
Ans: RAID 10 = RAID 1 + 0 = STRIPE OF MIRRORS

Q20. What does a RAID 0 configuration look like?
Ans: IF WE HAVE 3 DRIVES, WE ARE EVENLY DISTRIBUTING OUR FILES ACROSS ALL 3 FILES (STRIPING).

IF WE LOSE ANY OF THE DRIVES, OUR DATA IS INACCESSIBLE.

Q21. What is RAID 1 plus 0?
Ans: WITH THE ABOVE CONFIGURATION, WE ALSO ADD THE RAID 1 (MIRRORING) ASPECT AND MIRROR ALL OF OUR RAID 0 ARRAYS.

WE ARE STILL STORING 3 STRIPES OF DATA AND MIRRORING EACH OF THOSE STRIPES.

IF WE LOSE ANY OF THESE DRIVES, WE ARE STILL UP AND RUNNING BECAUSE WE HAVE AN EXACT DUPLICATE OF THE STRIPE LOST.

EVEN IF WE LOST ALL 3 DRIVES, WE COULD STILL HAVE ACCESS TO OUR DATA AS LONG AS THE OTHER 3 MIRRORED COPIES (RAID 1) ARE AVAILABLE.

Q22. What are the benefits of RAID 1 plus 0?

Ans: (SPEED OF STRIPING, REDUNDANCY OF MIRRORING)

WE HAVE INCREASED DATA REDUNDANCY (VS. RAID 0 OR RAID 5) - THE MIRRORED DRIVE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE DATA ACCESS.

SIMPLIFIED MANAGEMENT (AUTOMATICALLY BY RAID CONTROLLER / SOFTWARE)

FLEXIBILITY IN DRIVE CONFIGURATIONS - CAN USE A MINIMUM OF 4 DRIVES BUT LARGER CONFIGURATIONS WITH MORE DRIVES ARE POSSIBLE.

FAST DATA REBUILD TIME WITH COPYING DATA FROM MIRRORED DRIVE(S).

PERFORMANCE BENEFITS (READ, WRITE) OF RAID 0 + DATA REDUNDANCY OF RAID 1 (STRIPING + MIRRORING)

FAULT TOLERANCE - MULTIPLE DRIVE FAILURES CAN BE TOLERATED AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT OCCUR WITHIN THE SAME MIRRORED SET.

CONS : A LOT OF STORAGE / DRIVES REQUIRED (INEFFICIENT USE OF DISK SPACE)
