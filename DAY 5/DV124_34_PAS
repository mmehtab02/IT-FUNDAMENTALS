34_PAS_On An Overview of Memory
Possible Answer Sheets
Q1. What is RAM?
Ans: RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY IS A TYPE OF MEMORY USED IN COMPUTERS.
IT IS IN REFERENCE TO THE HIGH SPEED TEMPORARY STORAGE AREA THAT IS USED WHEN YOU LOAD AN APPLICATION OR DOCUMENT FOR EXAMPLE.
TO USE THIS INFORMATION IT MUST BE LOADED INTO THE RAM.
THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE HARD DRIVE STORAGE AREA (PERMANENT MEMORY).
THESE ARE DESIGNED TO TRANSFER DATA VERY QUICKLY BETWEEN THE INFORMATION THAT’S IN THE MEMORY MODULES AND THE CPU OF YOUR SYSTEM. THE FASTER YOU CAN TRANSFER INFORMATION BETWEEN THESE COMPONENTS, THE FASTER YOUR OVERALL SYSTEM WILL BE.

Q2. What type of memory slots are used in computers nowadays?
Ans: DIMM / SO-DIMM WITH DIFFERENT DDR VERSIONS.

NOWADAYS PRACTICALLY EVERYONE USES THE EXACT SAME TYPE OF MEMORY SLOTS IN THEIR DEVICES.


Q3. The specific type of memory in your system can vary widely so make sure you look at your_____________________ to know exactly what type of memory needs to be installed in those memory slots.
Ans.  MOTHERBOARD DOCUMENTATION

Q4. What is a SO-DIMM?
Ans: SMALL OUTLINE DUAL IN-LINE MEMORY MODULE - SMALLER SIZED DIMM, ABOUT HALF THE WIDTH. THESE ARE COMMON ON LAPTOPS AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES WHERE SPACE IS AT A PREMIUM.

Q5. How do you install a DIMM onto memory slots on a motherboard?
Ans: YOU FIT THE DIMM / SO-DIMM INTO A SLOT AND THEN PUSH DOWN AND LOCK THEM IN PLACE.

PUSH IT LIGHTLY INTO THE SLOT AND THERE ARE CLIPS ON THE END THAT WILL HOLD THE MEMORY IN PLACE SO IT CAN’T ACCIDENTALLY BE REMOVED.

Q6. Another common specification for these DIMMs is information is transferred in and out of the DIMM in _____________________data widths.
Ans. 64-BIT

Q7. What type of memory modules are typically used on laptops?
Ans: SO-DIMM

Q8. What type of memory should I install in the memory slots of my system?
Ans: IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF SYSTEM - COULD BE DIMM, SO-DIMM - AND THERE COULD BE SPECIFIC DDR VERSIONS (1, 2, 3).

MAKE SURE TO REFER TO YOUR MOTHERBOARD DOCUMENTATION / MANUFACTURER DOCUMENTATION.

Q9. What is the black component on memory modules?
Ans: THAT IS THE RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY LOCATED ON THE MODULE (THE MEMORY ITSELF - ALSO REFERRED TO AS DYNAMIC RAM).

Q10. Why do we refer to RAM as a D-RAM?
Ans. DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY - THIS CONSTANTLY NEEDS TO BE REFRESHED SO THAT THE DATA DOES NOT DISAPPEAR.

THERE’S ALWAYS A POWER SOURCE PROVIDING THAT REFRESHING OF THE INFORMATION THAT’S IN THE MEMORY MODULES.

Q11. What does the random part of random access memory mean?
Ans: WE CAN ACCESS ANY DATA THAT’S ON ANY PART OF THIS MODULE BY SIMPLE ASKING FOR IT. ANY STORAGE LOCATION CAN BE ACCESSED DIRECTLY (UNLIKE MAGNETIC TAPE).

WE DON’T HAVE TO FORWARD OR REWIND THROUGH THE MODULE.

WE CAN SIMPLY REQUEST A PARTICULAR AREA OF MEMORY AND HAVE THAT INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US DIRECTLY FROM THE D-RAM.
Q12. What is the clock on our system used for?
Ans: ON OUR PERSONAL COMPUTERS, THE MEMORY IS ALSO SYNCHRONOUS (SDRAM).

THIS REGULATES THE FLOW OF DATA IN AND OUT OF THESE MEMORY MODULES. YOU QUEUE UP ONE PROCESS WHILE WAITING FOR ANOTHER. CLASSIC DRAM DIDN’T WAIT FOR A CLOCK SIGNAL.

EVERY CLOCK CYCLE, THERE WILL BE SOME DATA TRANSFERRED EITHER IN OR OUT OF THIS SYSTEM.

IT PROVIDES A STANDARD TIME FRAME FOR SENDING / RECEIVING DATA FROM YOUR MEMORY.

IT ALSO ALLOWS ALL OTHER COMPONENTS OF YOUR MOTHERBOARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THIS DATA WILL BE TRANSFERRED.

Q13. Why are there notches on the bottom of the DIMMs and SO-DIMMs?
Ans: THESE PREVENT US FROM USING THE WRONG TYPE OF MEMORY IN OUR SYSTEM (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5)

Q14. What if you try to install a DDR2 module into a system with a DDR3 slot?
Ans. YOU WILL NOTICE THAT PARTICULAR NOTCH WILL NOT ALLOW THAT PARTICULAR MEMORY TO BE INSTALLED.

Q15. What is the difference between SDR memory and DDR memory?
Ans: OLDER COMPUTERS USE SINGLE DATA RATE MEMORY. ONLY ONE CLOCK CYCLE IS ABLE TO TRANSFER ONE BIT OF DATA.

OUR MODERN SYSTEMS USE DOUBLE DATA RATE (DDR) TO TRANSFER TWICE AS MUCH DATA IN EACH CLOCK CYCLE.

Q16. What does DDR stand for?
Ans. DOUBLE DATA RATE MEMORY.

Q17. Why do we use DDR?
Ans. THIS CAN TRANSFER TWICE THE AMOUNT OF DATA IN A CLOCK CYCLE, WHICH MEANS WE CAN EFFECTIVELY TRANSFER TWICE AS MUCH THAN A SDR MEMORY MODULE.

Q18. ___________allowed you to increase the data rates to be twice as fast as those older DDR2 systems.
Ans. DDR3 (DOUBLE DATA RATE VERSION 3)

Q19. What is the maximum RAM of DDR3 memory modules?
Ans: 16 GB PER MODULE

Q20. What does the notch at the bottom of a DDR3 memory module do?
Ans: THIS ENSURES THAT IT WILL ONLY BE INSTALLED ON A SYSTEM THAT CAN SUPPORT DDR3 (NO BACKWARDS/FORWARDS COMPATIBILITY)

Q21. What is the maximum amount of storage on a single DDR4 module?
Ans: 64GB PER MODULE

Q22. What type of memory is supported by newer motherboards?
Ans: DDR4 OR DDR5

Q23. What is the difference between DDR4 and DDR5 memory?
Ans: MAXIMUM STORAGE SIZE OF A SINGLE MODULE IS STILL 64GB, BUT DDR5 PROVIDES A FASTER THROUGHPUT THAN DDR4.

FASTER DATA TRANSFERS BETWEEN MEMORY MODULE AND MOTHERBOARD.
