Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. What is one of the biggest challenges when it comes to maintaining the operation of a computer?
Ans: MAKING SURE IT REMAINS COOL AS OUR COMPUTERS CREATE A LOT OF HEAT. WE NEED TO MAINTAIN GOOD TEMPERATURE INSIDE OUR COMPUTER CASE.

Q2. How can we provide cooling for our computers?
Ans: ONE COMMON WAY IS TO USE COOL AIR. COOL AIR IS PULLED THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE SYSTEM, PASSING BY THE HOT COMPONENTS, AND THE WARM AIR IS PUSHED OUT THE BACK OF THE SYSTEM.

Q3. What factors should be taken into account when thinking about cooling a system? Ans: WHERE THE AIR IS BROUGHT IN AND WHERE IT GOES DEPENDS ON THE CASE AND STYLE OF THE MOTHERBOARD.

THE LAYOUT OF THE SYSTEM INSIDE WILL ALSO AFFECT THE FLOW OF AIR, SUCH AS CABLES OR ADAPTERS.

THERE ARE SEVERAL OPTIONS SUCH AS MULTIPLE FANS, DIFFERENT SIZED FANS, AND SETTING UP COMPONENT LOCATIONS IN THE SYSTEM TO IMPROVE THE AIRFLOW.

Q4. What type of adapter cards have a fan directly connected to them?
Ans: VIDEO ADAPTER CARDS TEND TO HAVE FANS ATTACHED ON THEM. IT ADDS TO THE BULK AND SIZE OF THE CARD ITSELF SO THERE NEEDS TO BE ACCOMODATION FOR SPACE FOR THE FANS TO FREELY SPIN.

OFTEN THIS IS SEEN ON HIGH END CARDS LIKE VIDEO CARDS OR OTHER ADAPTER CARDS THAT REQUIRE A LOT OF PROCESSING POWER AND TEND TO GET VERY HOT.

Q5. What is a fan controller?
Ans: A CONTROLLER BUILT INTO THE MOTHERBOARD THAT CAN CONTROL HOW MUCH AIRFLOW IS GOING THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM. IT CONTROLS THE SPEEDS AND MEASURES TEMPERATURES THROUGH SENSORS.

Q6. Is it possible to replace a loud fan with a quieter one?
Ans: YES

Q7. Are there any computer systems that have no fans at all?
Ans: YES, THEY ARE SILENT AND THE COOLING IS DONE PASSIVELY. THIS COMMON ON SYSTEMS THAT ARE VERY SMALL, SUCH AS ONES YOU PUT NEXT TO A TV TO PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF MEDIA SERVICE, SATELLITE RECEIVERS, MEDIA SERVERS, VIDEO SERVERS, ETC.

Q8. What kind of tests is a passively cooled system put through?
Ans: IF A SYSTEM IS COOLED PASSIVELY, THE MANUFACTURER MOST LIKELY PUT IT THROUGH A NUMBER OF TESTS TO MAKE SURE IT WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH COOLING NECESSARY TO KEEP THE SYSTEM RUNNING EVEN WITH EXTENSIVE USE.

Q9. What is used for passive cooling?
Ans: A HEAT SINK


Q10. What is a heat sink?
Ans: A DESIGNATED PIECE OF METAL FOR COOLING. IT IS USUALLY COPPER OR ALUMINUM ALLOY AND IT HAS A SPECIFIC SHAPE THAT ALLOWS IT TO TAKE HEAT FROM A COMPONENT AND DISSIPATE IT AS AIR PASSES BY THE HEAT SINK. IT CAN GET VERY HOT.

Q11. Thermal paste referred to as ___________________or____________.
Ans. THERMAL GREASE
CONDUCTIVE GREASE

Q12. What is thermal paste?
Ans: IT IS THE MATERIAL YOU PUT IN BETWEEN THE HEAT SINK AND THE COMPONENT THAT ALLOWS IT TO RECEIVE AS MUCH HEAT AS POSSIBLE WITH AN EFFICIENT THERMAL CONNECTION. IT CREATES A GOOD BOND BETWEEN THE 2 COMPONENTS.

Q23. How is the liquid cooled?
Ans: THERE IS A CONNECTION TO THE CPU WITH A BLOCK AND THERE IS AN IN AND OUT CONNECTION ON THAT BLOCK AND THE LIQUID WOULD FLOW TO THIS RADIATOR. THERE ARE FANS ON THE INSIDE THAT ARE BLOWING AIR THROUGH THE RADIATOR TO COOL THE LIQUID THATâ€™S ON THE INSIDE.

RADIATOR RECEIVING COOL AIR FROM THE OUTSIDE, THE LIQUID ITSELF IS CYCLED THROUGH THE CPU BLOCK AND BACK TO THE RADIATOR.

Q24. What is connected to the liquid-cooled system?
Ans: A RADIATOR

Q25. What happens to the hot water from the CPU?
Q26. What happens as the hot water goes through the radiator?
Q27. What happens to the cool water after it is cooled down?
Ans: IT IS SENT THROUGH THE RADIATOR, WHICH HAS COOL AIR BLOWING THROUGH AND COOLING THE WATER DOWN. THE COOL WATER IS THEN BROUGHT BACK TO THE CPU, RESTARTING THE CYCLE.
