43_SAS_On Expansion Cards
Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. What is one way to extend and add to the capabilities of a system?
Ans: WE ARE ABLE TO EXTEND CAPABILITIES TO OUR MODERN COMPUTING PLATFORMS BY ADDING ADDITIONAL HARDWARE TO OUR SYSTEMS, AND THE PRIMARY WAY TO DO THIS IS WITH EXPANSION CARDS. YOU SIMPLY PURCHASE ONE, INSTALL IT, AND YOU NOW HAVE EXTENDED CAPABILITIES. THIS IS DESIGNED FOR END-USER INSTALLATION. IT COULD BE JUST HARDWARE, OR IT MIGHT INVOLVE INSTALLING A HARDWARE DRIVER (SOFTWARE) SO THIS NEW HARDWARE INTEGRATES TO THE OPERATING SYSTEM.

Q2. How do you install an expansion card?
Ans: YOU REMOVE THE TOP OF YOUR CASE, FIND AN AVAILABLE EXPANSION SLOT, PLACE THE CARD INTO THAT SLOT, GENTLY PUSH THIS CARD INTO PLACE MAKING SURE THAT THE HOLES / KEYS IN THE CARD MATCH THE INTERFACE IN THE SLOT. PUSH IT ALL THE WAY DOWN AND NOW YOU HAVE A CARD READY TO BE USED BY YOUR SYSTEM.

INSTALL THE HARDWARE (PHYSICAL) THEN YOU  MAY ALSO NEED TO INSTALL THE SOFTWARE (DRIVER).

Q3. What type of card might be installed?
Ans: YOU MAY INSTALL A CARD FOR AUDIO (PROVIDE OUTPUT OF HIGH-END AUDIO).

Q4. What might the sound card provide?
Ans: HIGH-END AUDIO, ADVANCED HEADPHONE AMP, HOME THEATER (OUTPUT)

ALSO MAY WORK AS AN INPUT (MUSIC CAPTURE, PODCASTING, MICROPHONE).

Q5. What kind of audio outputs does this sound card provide?
Ans: YOU MIGHT WANT TO INTEGRATE AN EXTERNAL MIXER / HEADPHONE AMP INTO YOUR SYSTEM, OR YOU MAY BE USING THIS OUTPUT TO PROVIDE A HIGH QUALITY AUDIO.

YOU MAY BE ABLE TO RECORD OR PROVIDE INPUT (SUCH AS RECORDING OR CAPTURING AUDIO) (COMMON FOR PODCASTS OR CREATING A VIDEO TRAINING COURSE).

YOU MAY USE OUTPUTS FOR S/PDIF (A DIGITAL FORMAT) AND BOTH FRONT-RIGHT AND LEFT-RIGHT SPEAKERS ON THE SOUND CARD.

THE SOUND CARD MAY HAVE OTHER INTERFACES AND PROVIDE OTHER CAPABILITIES.

Q6. What should I do to check what other options I have with my sound card?
Ans: CHECK THE DOCUMENTATION TO SEE WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE.

Q7. Do I need an external video card if I only need basic video capabilities?
Ans: NO, MANY CPUS ALREADY HAVE VIDEO TECHNOLOGY BUILT INTO THE CPU PACKAGE ITSELF (INTEGRATED GPU).

Q8. What is a discrete graphics card?
Ans: IT IS IN REFERENCE TO AN EXTERNAL VIDEO ADAPTER CARD WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN THE INTEGRATED GPU IN YOUR CPU. (USED FOR HIGHER PERFORMANCE LIKE GAMING OR GRAPHICS APPLICATIONS)

Q9. What types of interfaces are typically found on the back of a computer with an integrated graphics card?
Ans: VGA, DVI, HDMI CONNECTIONS MIGHT BE ON THE MOTHERBOARD.

THE INTERFACES ON THE VIDEO CARD CAN BE SIMILAR, LIKE DVI, DISPLAYPORT, HDMI OUTPUT.

Q10. How do we use the higher-end capabilities of this card?
Ans: PLUG IN YOUR MONITOR INTO ONE OF THESE INTERFACES THAT ARE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE VIDEO CARD.

Q11. What do you need to take advantage of a discrete graphics processor?
Ans: PLUG INTO THE CARD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DISCRETE GRAPHICS PROCESSOR, VS. PLUGGING INTO THE INTERFACES OF THE MOTHERBOARD WHICH USES THE INTEGRATED GRAPHICS.

Q12. How do you provide live streaming?
Ans: IF YOU WANT TO CAPTURE VIDEO OR PROVIDE LIVE STREAMING YOU WOULD NEED SOME TYPE OF EXTERNAL CARD TO RECEIVE THAT VIDEO SIGNAL SUCH AS A CAPTURE CARD WHICH ACTS AS A VIDEO INPUT INTO OUR COMPUTER.

THIS CARD IS DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN HIGH LEVELS OF VIDEO INPUT ESPECIALLY WHEN USING HIGHER RESOLUTIONS.

VIDEO AS INPUT THROUGH CAPTURE CARD.

Q13. What type of interface does the video capture card have?
Ans: PCIe INTERFACE IN THE EXAMPLE.

Q14. What type of video input does the card support?
Ans: AN HDMI CONNECTOR, AND AN SDI INTERFACE.

Q15. SDI stands for __________________.
Ans. SERIAL DIGITAL INTERFACE

Q16. How is the SDI brought in?
Ans: COAX

Q17. Does a motherboard come with a wired ethernet connection?
Ans: YES, THEY ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE MOTHERBOARD.

Q18. What is a Network Interface Card?
Ans: NIC PROVIDES ADDITIONAL ETHERNET CONNECTION INTERFACE(S) ON YOUR DEVICE. YOU MAY NEED THE EXTRA INTERFACE(S) OR YOUR INTEGRATED ETHERNET INTERFACE IS NO LONGER WORKING.
THESE ARE COMMON WITH SERVERS OR ROUTERS OR OTHER SPECIALTY DEVICES LIKE SECURITY DEVICES THAT NEED MULTIPLE INTERFACE ADAPTERS ON THE SAME PHYSICAL DEVICE.

Q19. When might you need to add an additional Network Interface Card?
Ans: YOU MAY NEED THE EXTRA INTERFACE(S) OR YOUR INTEGRATED (MOTHERBOARD) ETHERNET INTERFACE IS NO LONGER WORKING.

Q20. What is the process for installing a network interface card?
Ans: IT IS THE SAME PROCESS AS INSTALLING ANY OTHER DEVICE INTO AN EXPANSION SLOT.

FIND THE SLOT THAT’S AVAILABLE, PUSH THE ADAPTER CARD INTO THE SLOT.

SERVERS OR OTHER NETWORKING DEVICES MAY NEED MULTI-PORT ETHERNET ADAPTER CARDS. YOU CAN INSTALL ONE ADAPTER CARD AND ADD MULTIPLE (4 FOR EX.) SEPARATE ETHERNET CONNECTIONS.

Q21. What should you do before purchasing an adapter card?
Ans: MAKE SURE THE CARD IS COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR SYSTEM. CHECK YOUR MOTHERBOARD DOCUMENTATION AND DETERMINE HOW MANY DIFFERENT SLOTS ARE AVAILABLE AND WHAT THOSE SLOTS HAPPEN TO BE.

FROM THERE YOU CAN LOOK AT SPECIFICATIONS OF THE ADAPTER CARD AND MAKE SURE IT MATCHES THE SPECIFICATIONS OF YOUR MOTHERBOARD.

CHECK THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, THE MANUFACTURER’S WEBSITE, AND SUPPORT FORUMS.

Q22. What type of software do we need to use the adapter card?
Ans: THERE MAY BE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM TO INSTALL THE ADAPTER CARD. CHECK THE MANUFACTURER’S WEBSITE AND LOOK THROUGH TO CONFIRM THAT YOUR SYSTEM IS COMPATIBLE WITH THIS ADAPTER CARD.

CHECKING FORUMS MAY BE HELPFUL AS WELL. SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO INSTALL SOFTWARE PRIOR TO INSTALLING THE HARDWARE ADAPTER CARD, AND OTHER TIMES YOU INSTALL THE CARD FIRST THEN INSTALL THE SOFTWARE.

Q23. Why should I download the latest version of a device driver?
Q24.How do I install a driver?
Q25. What do you do when you need to install a new device driver?
-
Ans: THIS IS THE SOFTWARE THAT WILL ALLOW THE HARDWARE TO PROPERLY COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM.

THESE DRIVER SOFTWARES MAKE BE SEPARATELY INSTALLED OR ALREADY BE BUILT INTO YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM.

CHECK THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE ADAPTER CARD.

DRIVERS SHIPPING WITH YOUR HARDWARE MAY BE OUTDATED, THEREFORE CHECKING THE MANUFACTURER’S WEBSITE AND DOWNLOADING THE LATEST VERSION OF THE DEVICE DRIVER WILL BE A GOOD IDEA.

YOU MAY NEED TO UNINSTALL EXISTING DRIVERS THROUGH WINDOWS DEVICE MANAGER AND REINSTALL THE NEWER VERSION, OR YOU CAN INSTALL NEW VERSIONS OVER THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR HARDWARE COMMUNICATES PROPERLY WITH YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM, THEREFORE INSTALLING THE LATEST VERSION WILL BE THE CORRECT ROUTE TO TAKE.

SOMETIMES YOU CAN INSTALL THE DRIVER THROUGH THE WINDOWS DEVICE MANAGER, BUT SOMETIMES MANUFACTURERS HAVE CREATED THEIR OWN INSTALLATION EXECUTABLE.
-

Q26. How do you check if the operating system is using the new hardware properly?
Ans: THROUGH THE WINDOWS DEVICE MANAGER. YOU CAN ADD DRIVERS THIS WAY SOMETIMES AND ALSO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE SYSTEM TO CONFIRM YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM IS USING THIS NEW HARDWARE.

SINGLE FILE DRIVERS CAN AT TIMES BE INSTALLED THROUGH THE DEVICE MANAGER.
