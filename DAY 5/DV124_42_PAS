Self-Assessment Sheet
Q1. What is the main difference between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures?
Ans: 32-BIT OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE ON OLDER SYSTEMS. MOST OF THE LATEST OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE 64-BIT.
THIS IS IN REFERENCE TO THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE CPU.
A 32-BIT PROCESSOR CAN ACCESS UP TO 2^32 POWER OF INFORMATION (~4.3 BILLION) WHILE A 64-BIT PROCESSOR CAN ACCESS UP TO 2^64 POWER OF INFORMATION (VERY LARGE)

Q2. A 32-bit processor can access__________ gigabytes of information, whereas a 64-bit processor can access_____________billion gigabytes of information.
Ans. 4 GIGABYTES
17 BILLION GIGABYTES

Q3. How can you find the system type of your Windows system?
Ans: GO TO CONTROL PANEL → SYSTEM AND SECURITY → SYSTEM

IT WILL TELL YOU THE OPERATING AND PROCESSOR TYPES (32-BIT, 64-BIT)

Q4. What type of hardware drivers do you need if you are using a 32-bit operating system?
Ans: 32-BIT HARDWARE DRIVERS.
THE HARDWARE DRIVERS YOU INSTALL MUST MATCH THE TYPE OF OPERATING SYSTEM.

Q5. What is x86 software?
Ans: A FOLDER CALLED PROGRAM FILES X86 CONTAINS 32-BIT APPLICATIONS.

X86 SOFTWARE IS 32-BIT SOFTWARE.

Q6. How can you tell if applications have been written for a 64-bit operating system or a 32-bit operating system?
Ans: CHECK THE PROGRAM FILES FOLDER, OR PROGRAM FILES X86.

Q7. If you're running a 64-bit operating system, you can only run 64-bit applications, but you cannot run 32-bit applications. (True/False?
Ans. FALSE, YOU CAN RUN BOTH 32-BIT AND 64-BIT APPLICATIONS ON A 64-BIT OPERATING SYSTEM.

Q8. What is the Advanced Risk Machine?
Ans: ANOTHER FAMILY OF OPERATING SYSTEMS (ARM) THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY ARM LIMITED. THEY DESIGNED SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE HARDWARE AND THEN THIRD PARTIES USE THOSE SPECIFICATIONS TO CREATE ARM-BASED CPUS.
(THEY DESIGN THE CHIP, OTHERS LICENSE AND BUILD)

Q9. What are the benefits of the ARM architecture?
Ans: IT IS WELL KNOWN FOR BEING EXTREMELY EFFICIENT AND FAST IN ITS PROCESSING. IT USES LESS POWER, CREATES LESS HEAT, AND IT’S PERFECT FOR OUR MOBILE DEVICES.
(SIMPLIFIED INSTRUCTION SET)

Q10. What types of devices use ARM?
Ans: MOBILE DEVICES, INTERNET OF THINGS, AND THE CAPABILITIES OF ARM-BASED ARCHITECTURES ARE GREATLY EXPANDING.


Q11. We often refer to a CPU, or a Central Processing Unit, as a ________________.
Ans . SINGLE MONOLITHIC DEVICE.

Q12. The main processing of a CPU occurs on the _____________.
Ans. PROCESSOR CORE.

Q13. How many cores are in modern CPUs?
Ans: MULTIPLE CORES (DUAL CORE, QUAD CORE, MULTI-CORE).
NEWER PROCESSORS ARE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CORES.

Q14. What is not unusual for multiple cores in a CPU?
Ans: IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR MULTIPLE CORES TO ALSO HAVE MULTIPLE CACHES. THESE MIGHT HAVE CACHES DEDICATED FOR A CORE OR THEY MAY BE SHARED CACHES THAT ARE USED ACROSS ALL CORED. THESE ARE DESIGNED TO HELP SPEED THE PROCESSING OF INFORMATION IN AND OUT OF THE CPU.
L1, L2 CACHES, SHARED L3 CACHE.

Q15. If you start monitoring the amount of processing occurring on your CPU,you might see such as the _______________.
Ans. YOU MIGHT SEE IMAGES LIKE THIS IN AN APPLICATION, SUCH AS THE WINDOWS TASK MANAGER. YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENT PROCESSES OCCURING WHICH SEEMS LIKE 2 DIFFERENT CPUS, BUT THIS IS A SINGLE CPU CORE. THE REASON IT LOOKS LIKE MULTIPLE CPUS IS BECAUSE IT USES HYPER-THREADING TECHNOLOGY.


Q16. What does HTT stand for?
Ans. HYPER-THREADING TECHNOLOGY.

Q17. What is Hyper-Threading Technology?
Ans: YOU MIGHT HAVE A SINGLE PHYSICAL CPU CORE BUT IT LOOKS AND OPERATES LIKE MULTIPLE CPU CORES.

ONE CPU, ACTS LIKE TWO.

Q18. What is the impact of hyper-threading?
Ans:  YOU DON’T GET TWICE THE AMOUNT OF WORK FROM A SINGLE DEVICE. YOU SIMPLE INCREASE THE THROUGHPUT OF PROCESSES GOING THROUGH THE CPU BY SOMEWHERE AROUND 15% TO 30%.

YOU NEED A CPU THAT SUPPORT HTT, AS WELL AS YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM MUST SUPPORT HTT AS WELL.

Q19. Does a modern operating system support hyper-threading?
Ans: YES, YOU CAN CHECK THROUGH CPU MONITORING INTERFACES.
(WINDOWS XP AND LATER)

Q20. What kind of hardware is needed to virtualize additional operating systems?
Ans: IT IS RESOURCE INTENSIVE SO IT MADE SENSE TO TAKE THIS VIRTUALIZATION FUNCTIONALITY THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE IN A SOFTWARE AND PUT IT DIRECTLY INTO THE HARDWARE OF THE CPU.

MANY CPUS INCLUDE THIS HARDWARE THAT ALLOWS US TO VIRTUALIZE ADDITIONAL OPERATING SYSTEMS ON OUR COMPUTER.

VIRTUALIZATION IN SOFTWARE WAS LIMITED (PERFORMANCE AND HARDWARE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES). WE CAN RUN OPERATING SYSTEMS WITHIN A SINGLE HARDWARE PLATFORM (MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS SHARE PHYSICAL HARDWARE COMPONENTS)

CPU - VIRTUALIZATION WAS ADDED TO THE PROCESSOR. THE HARDWARE IS FASTER AND EASIER TO MANAGE.

Q21. How can I check if my processor supports Intel Virtualization Technology (VT) or AMD Virtualization (AMD-V)?
Ans: CHECK YOUR SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION AND YOUR BIOS.

YOU MAY NEED TO ENABLE THIS CPU VIRTUALIZATION.
