Self-Assessment Sheet
Q1. What is a hard drive?
Ans: HARD DISK DRIVE (HDD) - NON-VOLATILE MAGNETIC STORAGE WITH RAPID ROTATING PLATTERS.
Q2. A hard drive consists of spinning _____________.
Ans: MAGNETIC PLATTERS

Q3. Why are hard drives referred to as “non-volatile”?
Ans: INFORMATION / DATA IS RETAINED ON THE DRIVE EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO POWER TO THE SYSTEM.

Q4. Why do we refer to access on a hard drive as “random access.”?
Ans. WE DON’T HAVE TO FORWARD / REWIND INFORMATION LIKE YOU WOULD WITH A TAPE DRIVE. YOU CAN POWER ON YOUR SYSTEM AND ACCESS ANY BIT OF DATA ON THE HARD DRIVE.

Q5. What are the components inside a hard drive?
Ans: PLATTERS CONSTANTLY SPINNING.
ACTUATOR ARMS THAT MOVE BACK AND FORTH TO FIND DATA ON THE DRIVE.
(ACTUATOR, ARM, HEAD(S), PLATTER(S), SPINDLE)

Q6. What is a limitation of hard drives?
Ans: MECHANICAL COMPONENTS CREATE LIMITATIONS ON HOW QUICKLY WE CAN READ OR WRITE DATA ON THE STORAGE DEVICE.

THE MOVING PARTS WILL ALSO EVENTUALLY BREAK. THE HARD DRIVE WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL.

Q7. What is the eventual outcome of a hard drive?
Ans: IT WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL / MOVING PARTS WILL BREAK. THE QUESTION IS WHEN.

Q8. How does the data get stored and retrieved?
Ans : DATA IS STORED ON THE PLATTERS THAT SPIN AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED. IT ROTATES AROUND A SPINGLE IN THE MIDDLE.
THE ACTUATOR CONTROLS AN ARM THAT MOVES BACK AND FORTH OVER THESE PLATTERS TO BE ABLE TO READ AND WRITE DATA.

Q9. What affects the speed of data retrieval?
Ans: THE PLATTERS CAN SPIN AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS (RPMS) AND THE FASTER THEY SPIN, THE FASTER YOU WILL BE ABLE TO RETRIEVE DATA (OR SLOWER).

Q10. If the drive is spinning faster, for example, at 15,000 rotations per minute, then the rotational latency lowers to about ________________.

Ans : 2 MILLISECONDS

Q11. What does it mean if a common rotational speed for a low-end hard drive is 5,400 rotations per minute. And that gives you a rotational latency of about 5 and 1/2 milliseconds?
Ans. AS THE PLATTER SPINS (AT ITS RPM RATE), WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DATA TO MAKE ITS WAY BACK TO THE HEAD SO THAT YOU CAN EITHER READ OR WRITE THAT DATA.

THE ROTATIONAL SPEED AND ROTATIONAL LATENCY AFFECTS THE SPEED OF READING AND WRITING DATA ON THIS STORAGE DEVICE.

Q12. What happens if the drive is spinning faster?
Ans: THE LATENCY TIME LOWERS, AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO READ OR WRITE DATA FASTER.

Q13. What is the size of the hard drive in a larger desktop computer?
Ans: 3.5 INCH DRIVES

2.5 INCH ALSO POSSIBLE, MORE COMMON IN LAPTOPS.

Q14. What is a solid-state drive?
Ans. SSD DRIVE THAT HAS NO MOVING PARTS.

Q15. Why do we use non- volatile memory in SSD?
Ans. SO THAT WE CAN POWER OFF OUR SYSTEM AND OUR DATA REMAINS ON THESE SSDS.

Q16. What is one significant advantage of an SSD?
Ans: WE DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MECHANICAL FAILURES.

THE PERFORMANCE IS A LOT FASTER THAN AN HDD. WE DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RPM OR THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT WE CAN TRANSFER AS PLATTERS SPIN. WITH THE SSD, WE CAN ACCESS DATA DIRECTLY AND RETRIEVE IT AT EXTREMELY HIGH RATES OF SPEED.

Q17. What type of interface is often used for hard drives?
Ans: SATA INTERFACE

Q18. What is the advantage of having a laptop or mobile device?
Ans: THEY ARE PORTABLE. THE SIZE OF THE COMPONENTS AND THE DEVICE ITSELF IS SMALLER.

Q19. How does SATA limit the size of mobile devices?
Ans: THE 2.5 INCH AND 3.5 INCH SATA DRIVES TOOK UP SPACE INSIDE OUR MOBILE DEVICES, SO WE CREATED THE MSATA INTERFACE.

Q20. What is mSATA?
Ans: MINI-SATA. INSTEAD OF HAVING A SPINNING DRIVE INSIDE A CASE, OR AN SSD THAT MIMICS THE SIZE AND INTERFACE OF HDDS / SATA INTERFACES, WE CAN TAKE THAT SSD MEMORY AND PUT IT ON A MUCH SMALLER COMPONENT.

IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO FIND MSATA DRIVES IN MOBILE DEVICES, LAPTOPS, AND EVEN SOME DESKTOP SYSTEMS. BUT THESE ARE NOT VERY COMMON ON NEW DEVICES TODAY SINCE WE REPLACED IT WITH A MUCH MORE REASONABLE AND SMALLER TYPE OF COMPONENT (M.2)


Q21. What replaced the mSATA interface?
Ans: M.2 INTERFACE

Q22. What is an example of a device that contains an mSATA drive?
Ans: LAPTOP

Q23. How does the mSATA drive help reduce the overall size of devices?
Ans: IT TAKES UP MUCH LESS SPACE THAN A FULLY SIZED 2.5 INCH DRIVE, WHICH ALLOWED TO SHRINK DOWN THE SIZE OF THE DEVICES.

Q24. AHCI stands for the__________________.
Ans. ADVANCED HOST CONTROLLER INTERFACE

Q25. Why do we use AHCI?
Ans. IT MOVES DATA FROM THE STORAGE DRIVE INTO THE MEMORY.
SATA WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO TRANSFER DATA FROM HARD DRIVES. IT USES A PROTOCOL KNOWN AS AHCI.


Q26. _____________uses a protocol known as AHCI.
Ans. SATA

Q27. What is NVMe?
Ans: NON-VOLATILE MEMORY EXPRESS - NEW WAY TO COMMUNICATE TO OUR SSD VS SATA. IT IS DESIGNED TO MATCH THROUGHPUTS YOU WOULD NEED FOR TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS AN SSD.

Q28. What is the throughput of SATA revision 3?
Ans: 600 MEGABYTES / SECOND
OUR SSDS CAN EXCEED THESE VALUES THEREFORE THE SATA INTERFACE MAY BE LIMITING THE THROUGHPUT TO AN SSD.

Q29. What does lower latency and higher throughput mean?
Ans: IT MEANS WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FULL CAPABILITIES OF THAT TECHNOLOGY.

OVERALL IT WILL MAKE DATA COMMUNICATION FASTER.

Q30. What are the advantages of using M.2 instead of SATA?
Ans: IT IS MUCH SMALLER FORM FACTOR VS. SATA.
IT HAS A SINGLE CONNECTION TO THE MOTHERBOARD.
THERE IS NO EXTERNAL POWER THAT IS REQUIRED (MOTHERBOARD PROVIDES POWER)

CAN ALSO USE A PCIe BUS CONNECTION


Q31. What kind of interface is M.2?
Ans: THE M.2 INTERFACE CAN ALSO DIRECTLY CONNECT TO THE PCI EXPRESS BUS ON A COMPUTER, PROVIDING MUCH HIGHER THROUGHPUT VS. A SATA INTERFACE.

Q32. What type of throughput is typically seen when using an NVMe with an SSD through a by 4 PCIe interface?
Ans: 4 GIGABYTES / SECOND

Q33. What are the different keys in an M.2 interface?
Ans: M KEY
B KEY
SOME SUPPORT BOTH B AND M KEYS.

Q34. What should you do to ensure the best possible throughput for an M.2-based SSD?
Ans: YOU WANT TO BE SURE THAT YOUR SYSTEM CAN SUPPORT NVMe

YOUR INTERFACE MAY ONLY BE USING THE AHCI THROUGHPUT THAT YOU SEE WITH A SATA CONNECTION.

IT MAY ALSO ONLY SUPPORT ONE TYPE (M, B KEYS).

CHECK DOCUMENTATION OF YOUR MOTHERBOARD.

Q35. How do I install an M.2 drive on my motherboard?
Ans: FIND THE M.2 INTERFACE ON THE MOTHERBOARD AND SLIDE THE SSD INTO THE SLOT.
FASTEN THE SSD TO THE DRIVE USING A SCREW ON THE OTHER END OF THE SSD.

Q36. What does EEPROM stand for?
Ans: ELECTRICALLY ERASABLE PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY

Q37. EEPROM is a type of _________ memory.
Ans. FLASH MEMORY
NON-VOLATILE MEMORY (NO POWER REQUIRED TO RETAIN DATA)

Q38. What are the advantages of flash memory?
Ans: NON-VOLATILE MEMORY
HIGH DURABILITY
FAST ACCESS TIME (READ / WRITE)
COMPACT AND LIGHTWEIGHT
ENERGY-EFFICIENT
SILENT OPERATION
RESISTANCE TO MAGNETIC FIELDS
HIGH STORAGE DENSITY

Q39. What is one concern with flash memory?
Ans: IT HAS A LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU CAN WRITE INFORMATION TO THAT DRIVE.

ONCE YOU REACH THE THRESHOLD, YOU’RE ABLE TO READ INFORMATION ON THE DRIVE BUT YOU CANNOT REWRITE OR CHANGE ANY INFORMATION.

Q40. Is it recommended to use flash drives as archival storage?
Ans: NO - THEY ARE VERY SMALL STORAGE DEVICES THAT CAN BE EASILY LOST OR DAMAGED.

Q41. What type of flash memory do cameras and other mobile devices use?
Ans: SD TYPE FLASH MEMORY (SD)

MINISD, MICROSD (MOBILE)

COMPACT FLASH, xD PICTURE CARD (OLDER SYSTEMS)

Q42. What type of storage is becoming increasingly difficult to find on our systems?
Ans: OPTICAL DRIVE

(COMMON FOR ARCHIVAL MEDIA)
(RELATIVELY SLOW)
(MICROSCOPIC BINARY STORAGE)
(READ SMALL BUMPS OR COLORS WITH LASER)

Q43. What does an optical drive use to read small pits or different colors on an optical disk?
Ans: LASER

Q44. What are some of the most popular formats of optical drives?
Ans: CD-ROMS, DVD-ROMS, BLU-RAY

Q45. Are there external drives available for internal laptop or desktop use?
Ans: YES
THERE ARE OPTICAL DRIVES AS AN OPTION FOR INTERNAL LAPTOP / DESKTOP USE, AS WELL AS EXTERNAL OPTICAL DRIVES THAT CAN CONNECT VIA USB TO THOSE SYSTEMS.
