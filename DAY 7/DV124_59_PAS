59_SAS_How to Troubleshoot

Q1. What can you do when working with your computer at home?
Ans: YOU CAN DECIDE TO PERFORM AN OS UPGRADE, MODIFY SOMETHING ON THE NETWORK WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A LARGE SET OF PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES.

Q2. What is a formal change control process?
Ans: IF YOU’RE WORKING IN A LARGE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT, AND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE CHANGE TO AN APPLICATION OR AN OS, YOU WILL NEED TO FOLLOW SPECIFIC GUIDELINES IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT MODIFICATION.

THIS IS A FORMAL PROCESS FOR MANAGING CHANGE. IT IS A CORPORATE POLICY AND SET OF PROCEDURES.

Q3. What is the benefit of having a formal policy for making changes?
Ans: AVOID DOWNTIME, CONFUSION, AND MISTAKES.

IT LETS EVERYONE KNOW WHAT THE CHANGE WILL BE AND ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE THIS CHANGE IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT.

IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT CHANGE, IT GIVES OPTIONS FOR ROLLING BACK TO PREVIOUS CONFIGS.

Q4. What is a change control environment?
Ans: THE ENVIRONMENT IN A CORPORATE SETTING WHERE YOU ARE PLANNING TO MAKE A CHANGE THAT CARRIES FORMAL CORPORATE POLICY AND WELL-DEFINED PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGE(S).

IT MIGHT INCLUDE THE PROCESS FOR PLANNING FOR THE CHANGE, ESTIMATING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHANGE ON THE NETWORK, AND HAVING A RECOVERY PLAN IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG DURING IMPLEMENTATION.

Q5. What steps should be taken before making an actual change?
Ans: YOU WOULD RUN TESTS BEFORE THE CHANGE IN A LAB AND PERFORM A NUMBER OF SIMULATIONS TO SEE THE EFFECTS. THEN EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROCESS WOULD BE DOCUMENTED AND YOU PRESENT THE CHANGE REQUEST TO THE CHANGE CONTROL BOARD. THEY DECIDE ON THE CHANGE YOU DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT AND ANY DATES AVAILABLE TO IMPLEMENT IT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

-PLAN FOR A CHANGE
-ESTIMATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH IT
-HAVE RECOVERY PLAN IF CHANGE DOESN’T WORK
-TEST BEFORE MAKING THE CHANGE
-DOCUMENT EVERYTHING AND GET APPROVAL
-MAKE THE CHANGE

Q6. What is the Troubleshooting Process?
Ans: A STANDARD FLOW TO GO THROUGH TO HELP TROUBLESHOOT A PARTICULAR ISSUE EVERY TIME SOME TYPE OF PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED IS PRESENTED.

Q7. How does the troubleshooting process start?
Ans. A SYSTEM / APPLICATION THAT MAY BE BROKEN, AND IT TAKES YOU ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS TO A RESOLUTION.

Q8. What is the first step in the troubleshooting process?
Ans: IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND COLLECT AS MUCH INFORMATION AND DETAILS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE PROBLEM. DUPLICATE THE ISSUE IF POSSIBLE.

Q9. How is the first step of the troubleshooting process useful?
Ans: IT GIVES INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROBLEM. THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SINGLE SYMPTOM, BUT WITH COMPLEX APPS AND OSs THERE CAN BE MULTIPLE SYMPTOMS BY ONE OR MORE PROBLEMS.

THIS STEP WILL ALLOW YOU TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM EFFICIENTLY.

Q10. Why might it be beneficial to reach out to the user over the phone?
Ans: THEY SOMETIMES CAN TELL YOU MORE OVER THE PHONE ABOUT THE ISSUE THAN YOU WOULD EVER RECEIVE IN AN EMAIL DOCUMENTING INFORMATION. IT IS A GOOD WAY TO LEARN ABOUT THE PROBLEM DIRECTLY FROM SOMEONE WHO EXPERIENCED IT.

Q11. What should we do if we want to see if anything may have changed in the environment from the time that this was working until the time that this problem was reported?
Ans. LOOK AT YOUR RECORDS - THERE MAY HAVE BEEN PATCHES OR CHANGES TO THE APPLICATION. THE PROBLEMS MAY BE A RESULT OF THOSE CHANGES.

Q12. What is the best way to approach a troubleshooting process?
Ans: IF YOU BREAK DOWN THE SITUATION INTO SMALLER PIECES AND APPROACH EACH SYMPTOM AS ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM, YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER METHOD OF STEPPING THROUGH EACH ISSUE AND RESOLVING THE PROBLEMS.


Q13. What should be done before continuing with the troubleshooting process?
Ans: TAKE BACKUPS OF EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SO YOU HAVE A METHOD TO ROLLBACK IN CASE ANY CHANGES TO AN APP OR THE OS DURING TROUBLESHOOTING LEADS TO PROBLEMS.

Q14. What documents should be consulted to identify a potential issue with an application?
Ans: THE DOCUMENTATION FROM THE CHANGE CONTROL BOARD
OR THE LOG FILES OF THE APP / OS TO GIVE MORE INSIGHT INTO THE PROBLEMS.


Q15. What does Occam's razor tell us?
Ans. THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION IS OFTEN THE MOST LIKELY.

Q16. What should we do when trying to determine the root cause of an application issue?
Ans: START LOOKING AT THE MOST OBVIOUS CAUSES.

IF IT’S AN UNCOMMON, MAKE A LIST OF ALL CAUSES LISTING IN ORDER FROM MOST OBVIOUS TO MORE UNUSUAL, THAT WAY WE CAN TEST OUT THEORIES TO FIND THE ROOT CAUSE.

Q17. What should be done if all of the theories on the list have been tried and the root cause still cannot be identified?
Ans: BRING IN A THIRD PARTY OR AN EXPERT WHO HAS WORKED WITH THE TYPES OF PROBLEM AT HAND.

Q18. What do we need to implement the troubleshooting step in the production environment?
Ans: YOU NEED A PLAN TO INCORPORATE THE CHANGE AND REVERT BACK IN CASE OF ANY ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS.

LOOK AT DOCUMENTATION FROM OS VENDOR OR APPLICATION VENDOR TO SEE SUGGESTIONS FOR THIS PARTICULAR FIX.

THEN YOU CAN CREATE A PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTING THE FIX IN THE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.

YOU MAY NEED MORE THAN ONE PLAN FOR PROBLEMS THAT ARISE DURING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIX.

Q19. What should be done if something unexpected happens during the implementation of the plans?
Ans: YOU CAN ROLLBACK EVERYTHING TO THE ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION.

Q20. Do the change control board give us a time and a date to make the change?
Ans. YES, THERE IS A CERTAIN WINDOW WHERE THINGS ARE DOWN AND EVERYTHING SHOULD BE COMPLETED IN THIS CHANGE CONTROL WINDOW.

Q21. : What should be done if there is limited time to fix the application issue?
Ans: PULL IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP PERFORM MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY.

Q22. How can you tell if the fix worked?
Ans: PERFORMING TESTS - THERE ARE A SET OF TESTS YOU SHOULD HAVE DEFINED PRIOR TO MAKING THE CHANGE THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO TEST THE ENVIRONMENT, CONFIRM IT’S STILL WORKING, AND CONFIRM THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED.


Q23. What do we need to do after resolving an issue?
Ans: WE HAVE TO DOCUMENT EVERYTHING WE DID TO CONFIRM THE CHANGES MADE AS WELL AS HAVE INFORMATION ON THIS PROBLEM FOR THE FUTURE IF IT OCCURS AGAIN.

THE DOCUMENT MIGHT LIST SYMPTOMS THE USERS WERE HAVING, LIST OUT ALL CHANGES MADE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS, AND EXPLAIN THE RESULTS AFTER IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGES.

Q24. Most environments will have help desk software or _______________that’s perfect for adding this documentation so that everyone will have access to this data.
Ans.
KNOWLEDGE-BASED SOFTWARE

Q25. What is the troubleshooting process?
Ans: WE START WITH A SYSTEM OR APP THAT IS BROKEN, WE IDENTIFY AND GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROBLEM, CREATE A LIST OR SET OF THEORIES ON WHAT WE THINK IS THE ISSUE, STEP THROUGH EVERY SINGLE THEORY TO SEE IF IT FIXES THE PROBLEM OR NOT. IF IT DOES, WE CREATE A PLAN OF ACTION FOR IMPLEMENTING THE FIX IN OUR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. ONCE WE GET A SLOT FROM THE CHANGE CONTROL BOARD WE CAN IMPLEMENT THE PLAN. ONCE IT IS IMPLEMENTED, WE CAN VERIFY THE SYSTEM(S) ARE WORKING AS EXPECTED. THEN WE CAN DOCUMENT EVERYTHING WE DID FROM THE BEGINNING TO END SO WE KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT TIME IT ARISES AGAIN.

Q26. What do we need to do before implementing a plan to fix the issue during the troubleshooting process?
Ans. GET THE GO FROM THE CHANGE CONTROL BOARD.
