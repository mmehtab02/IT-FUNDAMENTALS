57_SAS_Cloud Characteristics
Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. What are internal clouds?
Ans. ONE WAY TO DEPLOY A CLOUD INSTANCE.

YOU ARE CREATING RESOURCES ON YOUR OWN INTERNAL NETWORK THAT WILL BE USED FOR APPLICATION DEPLOYMENTS.

INTERNAL CLOUD - NO RESOURCES SHARED, BUILD YOUR OWN CLOUD, PAY FOR EVERYTHING UP FRONT, NO ONGOING COSTS.

Q2. What does building your own cloud means?
Ans. YOU WILL BUILD OUT YOUR OWN DATA CENTER AND HAVE YOUR OWN RACKS TO INSTALL ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT FOR YOUR INTERNAL CLOUD.

Q3. What does using an external cloud mean?
Ans. YOU ARE USING TIME ON A THIRD-PARTY CLOUD PROVIDER SYSTEM.

YOU ARE SHARING RESOURCES ON A LARGE PUBLIC CLOUD, WHICH MOST OF IS STORED IN THE CLOUD PROVIDERS’ DATA CENTERS (AROUND THE GLOBE).

EXTERNAL CLOUD - SHARE RESOURCES WITH PUBLIC CLOUD, UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE OWNED BY A THIRD-PARTY, COST MAY BE METERED OR UP-FRONT.

Q4. If you’re using an external cloud, then you’re using time that might be on an _____________________.?

Ans. AMAZON, A MICROSOFT, OR SOME OTHER THIRD-PARTY CLOUD PROVIDER SYSTEMS.

Q5. The cost for this external cloud can vary based on the _____________
Ans. PROVIDER.

Q6. What is an external cloud?
Ans: REFERS TO PUBLIC CLOUD SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PART C.S.Ps. ORGANIZATIONS LEVERAGE CLOUD RESOURCES / CAPABILITIES THAT ARE HOSTED / MANAGED OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN DATA CENTERS / PRIVATE NETWORKS.

ALSO KNOWN AS PUBLIC CLOUDS / OFF-PREMISES CLOUDS.

INFRASTRUCTURE IS OWNED AND MANAGED BY A C.S.P. (HARDWARE,SOFTWARE,NETWORKING,VIRTUALIZATION, ETC.). ORGS. DON’T HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OVER THIS.

THIS FOLLOWS A SHARED RESOURCE MODEL WHERE MULTIPLE ORGS. / USERS SHARE THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES.

THEY OFFER WIDE RANGES OF SOLUTIONS (IAAS, PAAS, SAAS, ETC.)
THERE IS GLOBAL AVAILABILITY AND SCALABILITY, WITH DATA CENTERS LOCATED ACROSS THE GLOBE.

THIS FOLLOWS A PAY-AS-YOU-GO PRICE MODEL WHERE ORGS. ARE BILLED BASED ON THE RESOURCES THEY CONSUME.

Q7. What type of cost is associated with an external cloud?
Ans: THEY MAY REQUIRE A LARGE UPFRONT COST, OR MAY BILL YOU BASED ON HOW MUCH OF THE PLATFORM YOU USE, AND YOU WOULD PAY-AS-YOU-GO / ALSO REFERRED TO AS METERED CLOUD SERVICES.

THERE MIGHT BE COSTS FOR UPLOADING A FILE OR DOWNLOADING A FILE, OR STORING FILES ON THEIR PLATFORM WILL HAVE AN ONGOING COST.

METERED CLOUD SERVICES - PAY FOR WHAT YOU USE, COST TO UPLOAD, COST TO STORE, COST TO DOWNLOAD.

Q8. Is there a low entry cost for an external cloud?
Ans: YES, YOU DON’T HAVE TO PAY FOR ANYTHING ON THE PLATFORM UNTIL YOU USE IT. YOU CAN DECIDE HOW MUCH YOU WILL USE TO MATCH YOUR BUDGET / REQUIREMENTS.

Q9. What kind of cost do some platforms use?
Ans: SOME PLATFORMS LIKE TO GIVE A FIXED COST FOR EVERYTHING YOU MIGHT BE USING.

NON-METERED CLOUD SERVICES - PAY FOR BLOCK OF STORAGE, NO COST TO UPLOAD, NO COST TO DOWNLOAD.

Q10. What is an example of a non-metered cloud service?
Ans: DROPBOX / GOOGLE DRIVE - UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD FILES FOR FIXED COST.

Q11. What is one of the advantages of having a cloud-based application instance?
Ans. YOU ARE ABLE TO INCREASE / DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INSTANCES AS THE LOAD INCREASES / DECREASES.

Q12. What is rapid elasticity?
Ans. THE ABOVE ADVANTAGE OF ADDING / REMOVING CAPACITY IS SEAMLESS TO THE END USER AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THESE CHANGES IN THE BACK END. THIS IS KNOWN AS RAPID ELASTICITY.

RAPID ELASTICITY - SCALE UP AND DOWN AS NEEDED, SEAMLESS TO EVERYONE, CLOUD ENABLES INSTANCE RESOURCE PROVISION.

Q13. What does the cloud offer us?
Ans: THE CLOUD GIVES US A WAY TO INSTANTLY CREATE A MUCH LARGER CAPACITY ALL BY USING THESE BUILT-IN TECHNOLOGIES IN A CLOUD-BASED ENVIRONMENT.

Q14. What does this statement mean “Cloud-based platforms also tend to be highly available”?
Ans. SYSTEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE, REDUNDANCY PROVIDES AVAILABILITY.

THERE IS REDUNDANCY BUILT INTO THE CLOUD-BASED PLATFORM SO THAT IF POWER OR A SERVER IS LOST OR SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE, THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY TO KEEP EVERYTHING UP AND RUNNING BECAUSE THEY HAVE CREATED A REDUNDANT ENVIRONMENT.

Q15. What might happen if the power goes out at the data center?
Ans: THERE MIGHT BE A GENERATOR TO KEEP THE CENTER RUNNING.

Q16. What are some ways to provide redundancy in a data center?
Ans: A GENERATOR FOR POWER, REDUNDANT SERVERS, MULTIPLE NETWORK LINES, ETC.

EVERY CLOUD PROVIDER HAS A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF REDUNDANCY THEY MIGHT OFFER AND THIS HIGH AVAILABILITY IS AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE AN APPLICATION THAT NEEDS TO ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE TO YOUR END USERS.

Q17. How can you ensure data remains in sync when deploying application instances to different cloud providers in different countries?
Ans: MANY CLOUD PROVIDERS HAVE DIFFERENT METHODS FOR FILE SYNCHRONIZATION SO THAT YOU CAN DEPLOY DIFFERENT INSTANCES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, AND ALL OF THAT DATA IS SYNCHRONIZED BETWEEN ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT DATA CENTERS.

FILE SYNCHRONIZATION - INFORMATION CAN BE DUPLICATED ACROSS CLOUD LOCATIONS.

Q18. What is Desktop as a Service?
Ans: THE CLOUD ISN’T JUST FOR APPLICATION INSTANCES.

DAAS ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE YOUR ENTIRE WINDOWS DESKTOP RUNNING IN THE CLOUD. YOU CAN ACCESS THAT WINDOWS DESKTOP FROM ANY OF YOUR DEVICES (TABLET, PHONE, ETC.)

DAAS IS A CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODEL THAT DELIVERS VDI TO END USERS OVER THE INTERNET. THE ENTIRE DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT (OS, APPLICATIONS, DATA, ETC.) IS HOSTED AND MANAGED BY THE CSP AND CAN BE ACCESSED REMOTELY BY USERS ON THEIR DEVICES. THIS CAN BE DONE USING CLIENT SOFTWARE OR WEB BROWSERS. THE CSP TAKES CARE OF INFRASTRUCTURE, VIRTUALIZATION, SOFTWARE PROVISIONING, MAINTENANCE, SECURITY, ALLOWING USERS TO HAVE CONSISTENT DESKTOP EXPERIENCES ACROSS DIFFERENT DEVICES.

BASIC APPLICATION USAGE - APPLICATIONS RUN ON REMOTE SERVER, LOCAL DEVICE IS KEYBOARD, MOUSE, SCREEN.
(VDI, DAAS)

Q19. The applications that are running in this cloud-based service are running as a?
Ans. VDI

Q20. What does VDI stand for?
Ans. VIRTUAL DESKTOP INFRASTRUCTURE

Q21. What do you need to access your desktop from anywhere?
Ans: A MOUSE, KEYBOARD, SCREEN, INTERNET.

Q22. What are we most likely seeing on the tablet we are using to access this Windows desktop?
Ans: A SCREEN SHARE - YOU’RE EFFECTIVELY GETTING A REMOTE DESKTOP VIEW OF THAT WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT.

MINIMAL OPERATING SYSTEM ON THE CLIENT - NO HUGE MEMORY OR CPU NEEDS.

Q23. How important is the network connection if we are using Desktop as a Service?
Ans: IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN DAAS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE NETWORK.

NETWORK CONNECTIVITY - BIG NETWORK REQUIREMENT AS EVERYTHING HAPPENS ACROSS THE WIRE.

Q24. What technology does Desktop as a Service use?
Ans: REMOTE DESKTOP TECHNOLOGY IS USED TO SEND MINIMAL AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND THE DESKTOP.

BUT:

Q25. You need that _________________in order to take advantage of Desktop as a Service.
Ans. NETWORK CONNECTION

Q26. What is Amazon’s DaaS service called?
Ans. Workspaces


Q27. How can one create a Windows workspace using Desktop as a Service?
Ans: JUST CLICK A FEW BUTTONS TO CREATE A WINDOWS WORKSPACE.

Q28. What does Amazon’s Desktop as a service allow users?
Ans. IT ALLOWS YOU TO ACCESS A DESKTOP RUNNING A WINDOWS PLATFORM THAT LOOKS NATURAL, BUT IN ACTUALITY ALL OF THIS IS RUNNING ON THE AMAZON CLOUD.
