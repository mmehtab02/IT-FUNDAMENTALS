Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. What is an example of cloud capability?
Ans. THERE ARE MANY DEFINITIONS OF WHAT A CLOUD MEANS TO SOMEONE.

OFTEN THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS COMPUTING DEVICES LOCATED OFF SITE FROM WHERE YOU HAPPEN TO BE.
(FLEXIBILITY / MOBILITY)
(More than just a server hosted elsewhere)

BUT THE CLOUD INCORPORATES MANY MORE CAPABILITIES.
(Extend the management of applications and services)
___________________________________________________________________

ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE ABILITY TO SCALE RESOURCES DYNAMICALLY (UP OR DOWN) BASED ON DEMAND. INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE USERS CAN LEVERAGE THE CLOUD TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES AS NEEDED. SOMETHING LIKE A PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN : A COMPANY CAN SCALE UP THEIR SERVER FOR INCREASED TRAFFIC LOAD, THEN SCALE DOWN RESOURCES TO AVOID UNNECESSARY COSTS.

VERTICAL SCALING INCREASES RESOURCES ON A SINGLE SERVER, AND HORIZONTAL SCALING ADDS MORE SERVERS TO DISTRIBUTE WORKLOAD. ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE AGILE AND RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS ENSURING OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE AND COST EFFICIENCY.

OTHER EXAMPLES INCLUDE :

1. ELASTICITY (AUTOMATICALLY PROVISION / DEPROVISION RESOURCES BASED ON WORKLOAD FUNCTIONS, ALLOWING EFFICIENT RESOURCE UTILIZATION AND COST OPTIMIZATION.)

2. HIGH AVAILABILITY (REDUNDANT / FAULT-TOLERANT ARCHITECTURES ENSURING DATA / APPS ARE ACCESSIBLE IN EVENTS OF HARDWARE/SOFTWARE FAILURES.)

3. DISASTER RECOVERY (SERVICES FOR BACKING AND RECOVERING DATA REDUCING RISK OF DATA LOSS AND ENABLING QUICK RESTORATION)

4. FLEXIBILITY AND MOBILITY (USERS CAN ACCESS DATA, APPS, SERVICES FROM ANYWHERE USING VARIOUS DEVICES WITH AN INTERNET CONNECTION)

5. COST EFFICIENCY (PAY-AS-YOU-GO MODEL WHERE USERS PAY FOR RESOURCES THEY CONSUME, ELIMINATING NEED FOR UPFRONT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND ALLOWS COST OPTIMIZATION THROUGH RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND MONITORING)

Q2. Where can an application be deployed?
Ans. INSTEAD OF HAVING MULTIPLE COMPONENTS / SERVICES RUNNING INDIVIDUALLY (WEB SERVER, DATABASE SERVER, APPLICATION SERVER), THESE AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU MAY NEED CAN BE DEPLOYED WITH ONE CLICK, AND IT IS AVAILABLE TO ANYONE IN THE WORLD. (FLEXIBILITY / MOBILITY)
(Deploy an infrastructure in minutes)

YOU CAN ALSO DEPLOY MORE APPLICATION INSTANCES TO DEAL WITH A LOAD OF A BUSY APPLICATION WHEN REQUIRING MORE RESOURCES. WHEN IT IS DECREASED YOU CAN REMOVE EXCESS INSTANCES TO PERFECTLY SIZE THE APPLICATION.
(SCALING / ELASTICITY)
(Create and tear down as you need)

Q3. To deploy the application, you can use Data centers that are located in ____________.
Ans. UNITED STATES

Q4. Can you move those application instances from one data center to another where you are effectively following the sun?
Ans. YES
(International scope)

Q5. What is an efficient way to deploy an application?
Ans. AS PEOPLE NEED MORE ACCESS TO THE APP, THEY CAN USE A DATA CENTER CLOSEST TO THEM. THIS IS EFFICIENT FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE.

YOU DON’T HAVE TO BUY EQUIPMENT OR MAINTAIN A DATA CENTER. YOU CAN PAY FOR TIME ON SOMEONE’S CLOUD-BASED SYSTEM AND PAY FOR THE RESOURCES AS YOU NEED THEM (PAY-AS-YOU-GO).

Q6.  What do some organizations do instead of going to a third party for cloud service?
Ans. THEY PURCHASE THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT AND BUILD THEIR OWN CLOUD WITHIN THEIR OWN DATA CENTER

Q7. What is a private cloud?
Ans. A CLOUD THAT A COMPANY / ENTITY HAS ACCESS TO AND IT’S NOT DESIGNED TO BE SHARED WITH ANYONE ELSE.
(Private cloud - your own virtualized local data center)
___________________________________________________________________
A CLOUD COMPUTER ENVIRONMENT DEDICATED TO A SINGLE ORG. / ENTITY. IT IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EXCLUSIVE ACCESS AND CONTROL TO A SPECIFIC ORG. (BUSINESS, GOVERNMENT AGENCY, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE). THESE ARE CHOSEN BY ORGS. THAT PRIORITIZE DATA SECURITY, COMPLIANCE, AND CONTROL OVER THE INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS COMMON IN INDUSTRIES WITH STRICT REGULATIONS, SENSITIVE DATA, OR SPECIFIC WORKLOAD DEMANDS.

1. INFRASTRUCTURE OWNED - THE ORG. OWNS / MANAGES THE INFRASTRUCTURE (SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING EQUIPMENT, DATA CENTERS) WHICH ALLOWS DIRECT CONTROL OVER HARDWARE / SOFTWARE RESOURCES.

2. RESTRICTED ACCESS - LIMITED TO AUTHORIZED USERS WITHIN THE ORG. PROVIDING SECURE AND ISOLATED ENVIRONMENTS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR OTHER ENTITIES.

3. ENHANCED SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE - GREATER CONTROL OVER SECURITY MEASURES AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. THE ORGS. CAN IMPLEMENT THEIR OWN SECURITY POLICIES, ENCRYPTION STANDARDS, AND ACCESS CONTROLS TO PROTECT DATA AND MEET REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS.

4. CUSTOMIZATION & FLEXIBILITY - MORE CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS COMPARED TO PUBLIC CLOUDS. ORGS. CAN TAILOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES TO SPECIFIC NEEDS SUCH AS RESOURCE ALLOCATION, NETWORK CONFIG., AND SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT.

5. DEDICATED RESOURCES - THE ORG.’S RESOURCES (SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORK BANDWIDTH) ARE DEDICATED TO THEIR OWN USE WHICH ENSURES PREDICTABLE CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE AS RESOURCES ARE NOT SHARED WITH OTHERS.

6. INCREASED RELIABILITY - HIGHER LEVELS OF RELIABILITY / UPTIME VS. PUBLIC CLOUDS. ORGANIZATIONS CAN IMPLEMENT REDUNDANT HARDWARE, BACKUP SYSTEMS, DISASTER RECOVERY SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE CONTINUOUS AVAILABILITY OF THEIR SERVICES / DATA.

7. COST CONSIDERATIONS - THEY REQUIRE UPFRONT INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND ONGOING MAINTENANCE COSTS. THE PROS ARE THEY OFFER CONTROL, CUSTOMIZATION, SECURITY. THE CONS ARE THEY CAN BE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD / OPERATE VS. PUBLIC CLOUD SOLUTIONS.
___________________________________________________________________

Q8. Cloud services provided by Amazon, Microsoft, Rackspace, and others can be configured as what?
Ans. PUBLIC CLOUDS - YOU CAN DEPLOY APPLICATION INTERFACES THAT CAN BE USED BY ANYONE IN THE WORLD.
(Public cloud - available to everyone over the Internet)
___________________________________________________________________
CLOUD COMPUTING MODEL WHERE COMPUTING RESOURCES (SERVERS, STORAGE, APPLICATIONS) ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC OVER THE INTERNET. THESE ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY A THIRD-PARTY CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDER WHO MANAGES / MANTAINES THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY ARE COMMONLY USED BY ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZED / INDUSTRIES TO LEVERAGE THE BENEFITS OF SCALABLE COMPUTING POWER, STORAGE, AND SERVICES WITHOUT THE NEED TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE.
POPULAR EXAMPLES OF PUBLIC CLOUD PROVIDERS INCLUDE A.W.S., MICROSOFT AZURE, GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM, IBM CLOUD. THEY OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES / RESOURCES / TOOLS TO CATER TO DIVERSE COMPUTING NEEDS (VIRTUAL MACHINES, STORAGE, AI, BIG DATA ANALYTICS).

1. SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE - MULTIPLE USERS / ORGS. SHARE THE SAME POOL OF RESOURCES. THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS DESIGNED TO BE SCALABLE AND ELASTIC ALLOWING RESOURCES TO BE DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED BASED ON USER DEMAND.

2. ACCESSIBILITY - ACCESSIBLE OVER THE INTERNET ALLOWING USERS TO ACCESS THEIR APPS, DATA, SERVICES FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WITH AN INTERNET CONNECTION. THIS ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY / MOBILITY AS USERS CAN USE VARIOUS DEVICES TO ACCESS CLOUD SERVICES.

3. PAY-AS-YOU-GO MODEL - P.A.Y.G. MODEL OR SUBSCRIPTION-BASED PRICING MODEL. ONLY PAY FOR RESOURCES YOU CONSUME, ALLOWING COST OPTIMIZATION AND ELIMINATING COST FOR UPFRONT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS.

4. SCALABILITY - SCALE RESOURCES UP / DOWN BASED ON DEMAND. INCREASE OR DECREASE YOUR COMPUTING RESOURCES (VIRTUAL MACHINES, STORAGE, NETWORK BANDWIDTH) TO ACCOMMODATE FLUCTUATIONS IN WORKLOAD WITHOUT DISRUPTION.

5. MANAGED SERVICES - PUBLIC CLOUD PROVIDERS OFFER A RANGE OF MANAGED SERVICES / TOOLS THAT SIMPLIFY DEPLOYMENT, MANAGEMENT, AND MONITORING OF APPS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS CAN INCLUDE D.B. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORKS, MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORKS, ETC.

6. GLOBAL REACH - DATA CENTERS OPERATING IN MULTIPLE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS ENABLING USERS TO DEPLOY THEIR APPS / STORE DATA IN DIFFERENT REGIONS. THIS ENSURES LOW LATENCY AND DATA REDUNDANCY, AS WELL AS COMPLIANCE WITH DATA RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS.

7. HIGH SCALABILITY & RELIABILITY - DESIGNED TO HANDLE HIGH SCALABILITY & PROVIDE RELIABLE PERFORMANCE (REDUNDANT HARDWARE, FAILOVER SYSTEMS, LOAD BALANCING TECHNIQUES - ENSURE HIGH AVAILABILITY AND FAULT TOLERANCE)
___________________________________________________________________

Q9. What is the combination of using both a private and public cloud?
Ans. HYBRID CLOUD DEVELOPMENT - APPLICATION INSTANCES WHERE PART OF THE APP INSTANCE IS ON THEIR OWN PRIVATE INTERNAL CLOUD AND THE OTHER PART IS  MANAGES BY A THIRD PARTY LIKE AMAZON OR MICROSOFT.
(Hybrid - public + private)

Q10. What are the advantages of having a private cloud?
Ans. ENHANCED SECURITY AND CONTROL (INFRASTRUCTURE, DATA, SECURITY MEASURES, SECURITY POLICIES, ENCRYPTION STANDARDS, ACCESS CONTROLS, FIREWALL CONFIGS.)

DATA PRIVACY AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (HEALTHCARE, FINANCE, GOVERNMENT).

PERFORMANCE & RELIABILITY (RESOURCES DEDICATED TO ORG., IMPLEMENTATION OF REDUNDANT HARDWARE, BACKUP, DISASTER RECOVERY).

IMPROVED NETWORK PERFORMANCE (HIGH-BANDWIDTH CONNECTIONS DEDICATED TO ORG, LOW LATENCY AND FAST DATA TRANSFER).


MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE SIMILAR GOALS MIGHT CHIP IN TO PURCHASE THEIR OWN CLOUD EQUIPMENT, GIVING THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A PRIVATE CLOUD WITHOUT THE EXPENSE OF PURCHASING ALL THE EQUIPMENT JUST FOR THIS CLOUD. WITH COMMUNITY DEPLOYMENT, ALL OF THESE ORGS. CAN SHARE IN THE COST.
(Community - several organizations share the same resources)

Q11. What does an organization build that include a database, web server and other devices?
Ans. APPLICATION INSTANCE

Q12. A company may only need the _______________ to be able to load the software and deploy these cloud instances.
Ans. RAW INFRASTRUCTURE

Q13. If an organization only needs CPU storage and a network to be able to deploy this application instance, then they want to use ____________________as their cloud deployment model.
Ans. IaaS (infrastructure as a service)

Q14. What does HaaS stand for?
Ans. HARDWARE AS A SERVICE
(IaaS, HaaS - outsource your equipment)

Q15. Who is responsible for a large amount of implementation in this type of cloud model?
Ans. THE END USER (responsible for management & security)

Q16. What does a cloud provider provide?
Ans.  THE HARDWARE TO RUN THIS APPLICATION AND IN SOME CASES THE OPERATING SYSTEM.

BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE END USER’S RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE YOU ARE DEPLOYING THIS APPLICATION, DECIDING HOW AND WHERE THIS DATA IS STORED. IN IAAS, YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL AND SECURITY OF THAT DATA.
(Your data is out there, but more within your control)

Q17. What is an example of IaaS deployment?
Ans. A COMPANY THAT PROVIDES WEB SERVICES - THEY WOULD PROVIDE YOU WITH THE SERVER TO BE ABLE TO LOAD THE WEBSITE.
YOU - WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING AND DEPLOYING THAT WEBSITE CONTENT.

Q18. What is the one main benefit the end user has in SaaS?
Ans.  IN IAAS, THE END USER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APPLICATION, OS, AND EVERYTHING.

WITH SAAS, THE END USER DOESN’T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANYTHING RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OR THE OS.

Q19. What does SaaS stand for?
Ans. SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE

Q20. What isn’t required for any type of software?
Ans. (On-demand software - no local installation)

Q21. The end user can simply log in and manage an email distribution list, log in and manage their payroll or any other type of software as a ______________.
Ans. SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION

Q22. Who is responsible for maintaining the application, storing the data, and keeping all of that information safe?
Ans. THE SERVICE PROVIDER IS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.

THE END USER DOESN’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BUILDING THEIR OWN APPLICATION, DEPLOYING AN APPLICATION, UPDATING OR MANAGING IT, FINDING WAYS TO STORE AND PROTECT DATA.

Q23. Google mail is an example of _____________.
Ans. SAAS

Q24. Are you responsible for maintaining the google mail?
Ans.NO

Q25. What does Google do with the email system?
Ans. THEY STORE THE DATA, MAINTAIN THE APPLICATION, PROVIDE ONGOING MAINTENANCE.

Q26. A good example of Saas is ______________.
Ans. MICROSOFT 365 - EMAIL, WORD PROCESSING, SPREADSHEETS, AND EVERYTHING ELSE RELATING TO THAT CLOUD-BASED SERVICE IS ALL MANAGED BY MICROSOFT.

YOU JUST LOG IN AND THE ENTIRE APPLICATION IS AVAILABLE TO YOU.

Q27. The middle ground between Iaas and Saas is __________________.
Ans. PaaS - PLATFORM AS A SERVICE.

Q28. What is PaaS?
Ans. SOMEONE ELSE IS PROVIDING YOU WITH A PLATFORM YOU CAN USE TO BUILD YOUR OWN APPLICATIONS, SO YOU WOULD NEED A DEVELOPMENT TEAM, BUT SOMEONE ELSE IS PROVIDING YOU WITH ALL OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS YOU NEED TO PUT TOGETHER EVERY PIECE OF THAT APPLICATION.

NO SERVERS, SOFTWARE, MAINTENANCE TEAM, HVAC

Q29. What does the PaaS provider do?
Ans. THEY MAY ALLOW YOU TO LOG IN AND GIVE YOU A SET OF MODULES YOU CAN PUT TOGETHER TO BUILD YOUR OWN APP. YOU MIGHT HAVE A LOGIN MODULE, INVENTORY PAGE MODULE, AND ANOTHER PAGE THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CHECK IN / OUT PIECES OF THAT INVENTORY. YOU WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT MODULES AND PLACING THEM ON THE PLATFORM AS A SERVICE TO MAKE THAT APPLICATION AVAILABLE TO OTHERS.

THE SERVICE PROVIDER HAS BUILT THE PLATFORM SO YOU DON’T HAVE TO DO MUCH PROGRAMMING. THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF THE HARD WORK FOR YOU. YOU JUST NEED TO PUT THE MODULES YOU NEED TOGETHER AND THE PAAS PROVIDER TAKES CARE OF MAKING SURE YOUR DATA IS SAFE.

YOU DON’T HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE DATA, PEOPLE, OR INFRASTRUCTURE - TRAINED SECURITY PROFESSIONALS ARE WATCHING YOUR DATA.

Q30. ______________has an extensive platform as a service offering that gives you complete customization over the applications that you can easily deploy on their platform.
Ans. SALESFORCE.COM

Q31. If you were planning to deploy the applications in your own data center on your own hardware using applications that you yourself have written, then you’re probably using an ____________where everything in that model is managed by the client.
Ans. ON-PREMISES - APPLICATION, DATA, RUNTIME, MIDDLEWARE, OS, VIRTUALIZATION, SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING (EVERYTHING MANAGED BY CLIENT).

IN CLOUD BASED TECH, A PORTION IS MANAGED BY THE PROVIDER.

IAAS - VIRTUALIZATION, SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING (PROVIDER).
SAAS - EVERYTHING MANAGED BY CLIENT.
PAAS - CLIENT ONLY MANAGES APPLICATION AND DATA.
