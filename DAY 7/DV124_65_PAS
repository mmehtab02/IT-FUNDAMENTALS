DV500_65_SAS_Troubleshooting Networks
Self-Assessment Sheets

Q1. What is a challenging troubleshooting task on a network?
Ans: SOMEONE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEVICE BUT GETTING NO RESPONSE. THERE IS NO CONNECTIVITY TO THAT REMOTE DEVICE IT SEEMS. TO BE ABLE TO TROUBLESHOOT THIS WE TEND TO START WITH OUR LOCAL DEVICE AND WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THE NETWORK UNTIL WE RUN INTO A PROBLEM.

Q2. What should be the first step taken to troubleshoot this network issue?
Ans: CHECK IF WE HAVE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY AT ALL. CHECK THE LINK LIGHTS ON THE SWITCH AND ETHERNET INTERFACE.

Q3. What do we do to start testing how far we can communicate through a network?
Ans: ONCE WE KNOW WE ARE AT LEAST CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK WE CAN BEGIN TESTING HOW FAR WE CAN COMMUNICATE THROUGH THAT NETWORK.

WE WILL START ON OUR OWN DEVICE AND WE WILL PING THE LOOPBACK IP ADDRESS.
Q4. What is the loopback IP address?
Ans: THE INTERNAL IP OF OUR DEVICE, WHICH IS 127.0.0.1.

Q5. What if our loopback address responds to the ping?
Ans. WE ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE USING THE BUILT-IN NETWORK CAPABILITIES INSIDE OF OUR OWN DEVICE. NOW WE NEED TO START LOOKING FURTHER INTO THE NETWORK TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANY PROBLEMS.

Q6. Our next step would be to ping the IP address that’s been assigned to our _______________.
Ans. LOCAL NETWORK ADAPTER

Q7. What does pinging the IP address do?
Ans: THIS WILL LET US KNOW THAT THE PHYSICAL COMPONENT APPEARS TO BE WORKING PROPERLY.

IF WE PING OUR LOCAL ADDRESS IT WILL CHECK THE LOCAL CONFIG OF OUR SYSTEM, THE PHYSICAL NETWORK ADAPTER, AND CONFIRM THAT WE ARE INDEED CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK.

Q8. What should we do if the devices on the network respond to our ping?
Ans: WE SHOULD GO FURTHER INTO THE NETWORK AND TRY PINGING OUR DEFAULT GATEWAY.

Q9. Why is it important to check the default gateway?
Ans: EVERY NETWORK HAS A DEFAULT GATEWAY. SINCE IT IS A CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN US AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT DEVICE IS ABLE TO RESPOND BACK.

IF WE DO GET A RESPONSE FROM OUR DEFAULT GATEWAY THEN AT LEAST WE ARE SENDING PACKETS OUT TO OUR LOCAL NETWORK AND RECEIVING PACKETS BACK IN RETURN.


Q10. What is a common way to check if a network is connected to the internet?
Ans: TRY PINGING SOME DEVICE THAT MAY BE ON THE INTERNET - GOOGLE’S DNS SERVER AT 8.8.8.8, OR THE SERVER QUAD9 WHICH IS APTLY 9.9.9.9.

IF WE ARE ABLE TO PING EITHER OF THOSE IP ADDRESSES THEN WE CAN CONFIRM THAT WE ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO THE INTERNET AND BACK WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.

Q11. What could be the reason for intermittent connectivity on a wireless network?
Ans: IF ONLY PART OF OUR PINGS RESPOND ON A WIRELESS NETWORK, WE MAY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH INTERMITTENT CONNECTIVITY ON IT.

THIS MIGHT BE CAUSED BY SOME INTERFERENCE ON THE WIRELESS NETWORK. THERE MAY BE ANOTHER ACCESS POINT OR OTHER DEVICES NEARBY THAT ARE USING EXACTLY THE SAME FREQUENCIES AS OUR ACCESS POINT.

Q12. How can we check if the signal strength is strong enough?
Ans: WE MIGHT WANT TO CHECK THE SIGNAL STRENGTH ON OUR DEVICE TO CONFIRM THAT WE ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE ACCESS POINT TO RELIABLY SEND INFO BACK AND FORTH.

THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE THE SIGNAL STRENGTH VALUE. WE WILL NOT ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE SIGNAL WE ARE SENDING BUT ALSO THE TRANSMITTING ANTENNA WE ARE USING AND THE RECEIVING ANTENNA WE ARE USING.

Q13. Can access points be configured to automatically find the best frequency?
Ans: YES


Q14. How can I improve the overall performance of my wireless network?
Ans: YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK THE FREQUENCIES THAT ARE CONFIGURED IN YOUR ACCESS POINT AND SEE IF THEY ARE CONFIGURED TO BE MANUAL TUNING OR AUTOMATIC.
YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO TRY MANUALLY CONFIGURING DIFFERENT CHANNELS TO SEE IF THAT IMPROVES THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE WIRELESS NETWORK.

Q15. What can be done to optimize wireless signals?
Ans: THE WIRELESS SIGNALS TEND TO BOUNCE AROUND BETWEEN OBJECTS THAT MAY BE AROUND US. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION OR MODIFY THE LOCATION OF YOUR ACCESS POINT TO BETTER OPTIMIZE THE COMMUNICATIONS PATH BETWEEN YOU AND THE ACCESS POINT.

Q16. What is the goal of resolving intermittent connectivity issues?
Ans: THE PROBLEM MAY BE ABOUT LOCATION.

BEING AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE ACCESS POINT MAY PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE.

THE DISTANCE AND LOCATION OF YOU OR THE ACCESS POINT MAY RESOLVE ALL OF THESE COMMUNICATION ISSUES.

Q17. What built-in utilities can give you information about the interference?
Ans: YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM

Q18. __________________you can install that can give you more details about the difference between the good signal and the bad signal.
Ans. THERE MIGHT BE A THIRD-PARTY UTILITY

Q19. What could be causing interference on a wireless network?
Ans: FLUORESCENT LIGHTS, MICROWAVE OVENS, OTHER DEVICES USING THE SAME FREQUENCY AS YOUR ACCESS POINT.

A BUILDING WITH A LOT OF TENANTS USING EXACTLY THE SAME FREQUENCIES AS YOUR WIRELESS NETWORK.

Q20. How can you evaluate wireless network interference?
Ans: LOOK AT THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO (SNR) OF YOUR WIRELESS NETWORK WITH A UTILITY THAT IS ABLE TO CALCULATE THE SNR.

PERFORMANCE MONITOR IN WINDOWS MAY ALSO HAVE VIEWS WITH DETAILS ABOUT SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO.

(GREEN VS. RED)

Q21. What if this ratio was 1:1, where there was just as much noise as there was signal?
Ans. YOUR WIRELESS NETWORK WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE OPERATING.
A LARGE RATIO IS MORE DESIRED.

Q22. ______________is very good about giving you information in the system tray that can help you with troubleshooting.
Ans. WINDOWS

Q23. What if you’re looking at the system tray and Windows says there is limited or no connectivity, or in some cases, no internet access then what's the issue?
Ans. THE ISSUE IS WITH COMMUNICATING OUT TO THE INTERNET.

Q24. What should be checked first when troubleshooting IP address issues?
Ans: CHECK THE IP ADDRESS ASSIGNED TO OUR DEVICE. THIS SHOULD IDEALLY BE AN IP ADDRESS THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ASSIGNED BY A DHCP SERVER, OR IT’S ONE THAT YOU HAVE MANUALLY CONFIGURED ON THAT DEVICE.

Q25. What if we see an automatic private IP address in this configuration?
Ans. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DHCP SERVER THAT WE WERE EXPECTING TO RECEIVE AN IP ADDRESS FROM IS NOT AVAILABLE AND OUR SYSTEM HAS CREATED OUR OWN PRIVATE IP ADDRESS.

Q26. _______________addresses are link local addresses and can only communicate to other devices on our local network.
Ans: APIPA
.

Q27. What type of error message would a Windows device display when attempting to access the internet with an APIPA address?
Ans: “LIMITED OR NO CONNECTIVITY”
“NO INTERNET ACCESS”

Q28. How can we check whether or not a device has a valid IP address?
Ans: IF THE IP ADDRESS ON OUR DEVICE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED BY THE DHCP SERVER, WE CAN BEGIN THE NORMAL PING PROCESS WE SPOKE OF EARLIER TO CHECK OUR LOCAL MACHINE, OUR DEFAULT GATEWAY, AND THEN A CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET SO WE CAN FIND WHERE IN THE PATH WE ARE LOSING CONNECTIVITY.

Q29. What happens when a network experiences problems during a voice call?
Ans: YOU WILL HAVE A ROBOTIC NOISE OR SOUND LIKE PEOPLE ARE UNDERWATER.

Q30. If data doesn’t get through the network, there’s no way to rewind the conversation and rescind all of that data. (True/False)
Ans. TRUE

Q31. What is Jitter?
Ans: THERE ARE SOME STATISTICS WE CAN EVALUATE TO SEE HOW WELL OUR NETWORK MAY BE PERFORMING WITH THESE REAL-TIME PROTOCOLS. ONE OF THESE IS THE JITTER STATISTIC. IT IS DEFINED AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME BETWEEN EACH INDIVIDUAL FRAME ON THE NETWORK.

Q32. What is the purpose of evaluating jitter?
Ans: TO SEE THE INTERVAL DISTANCE BETWEEN FRAMES.

REGULAR INTERVALS BETWEEN FRAMES IS GOOD.

Q33. What happens when jitter is not consistent?
Ans: IF WE HAVE SOME TYPE OF DELAY OR LATENCY ON OUR NETWORK WE COULD HAVE LARGE GAPS BETWEEN THE FRAMES.

Q34. What could cause problems with the quality of our phone calls?
Ans: LARGE INTERVALS BETWEEN FRAMES ON THE JITTER STATISTIC CAUSED BY DELAY OR LATENCY ON THE NETWORK.

Q35. How to solve the issue of delay or latency on our network?
ANs. WE NEED A HIGH SPEED NETWORK AND LOW LATENCY.

THIS WILL ALLOW US TO TRANSFER AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

WE WOULD ALSO WANT TO CHECK HOW MUCH BANDWIDTH IS AVAILABLE ON OUR INTERNET LINK. IF SOMEONE IS USING ALL THE AVAILABLE BANDWIDTH WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BAD LATENCY AND DIFFICULTY MAKING VOICE CALLED.


Q36. What are some potential causes of network slowdowns?
Ans: OLD EQUIPMENT THAT IS NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE HIGH SPEEDS WE NEED (OLD ROUTER FOR EXAMPLE).

YOU MAY NEED TO REPLACE THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.

Q37. What is the best way to diagnose a network issue?
Ans:  PERFORM A PACKET CAPTURE TO GET MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHERE THE ACTUAL PROBLEM MAY BE OCCURRING.

Q38. What is latency?
Ans: THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES BETWEEN A REQUEST AND A RESPONSE.

Q37. What determines how much information can be transferred?
Ans: THE LATENCY VALUE HELPS DETERMINE HOW MUCH INFORMATION WE ARE ABLE TO TRANSFER BETWEEN TWO DEVICES.

Q38. What can cause latency problems?
Ans: THERE MAY BE A STEP ALONG THE WAY THAT EXCEEDS WHAT IS NORMALLY EXPECTED FOR LATENCY.

WE WOULD NEED TO EXAMINE THIS AND SEE EACH NETWORK BETWEEN BOTH OF THESE DEVICES AND BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPES OF LATENCIES ARE NORMAL FOR THOSE NETWORKS.


Q39. What is one of the best ways to measure latency?
Ans: PACKET CAPTURES - BEING ABLE TO GRAB EVERY PACKET GOING BACK AND FORTH CAN HELP YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME IS OCCURRING FROM ONE FRAME TO ANOTHER. YOU CAN GET DETAILS DOWN TO THE MICROSECOND SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DIFFERENCES MIGHT BE BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD LATENCY.

Q40. What is port flapping?
Ans: AN ISSUE RELATED TO SOME TYPE OF PHYSICAL ISSUE BETWEEN THE TWO DEVICES AND BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT LINK LIGHT.

IF YOU ARE ON A WIRED ETHERNET NETWORK AND YOU NOTICE YOUR LINK IS SOLID, THEN OFF, THEN BACK ON, AND OFF AGAIN, IT MAY BE A CASE OF PORT FLAPPING.

Q41. What should you do when you encounter a port flapping problem?
Ans: FIRST CHECK THE PHYSICAL MEDIA ITSELF - CABLE TESTER OR ADVANCED TESTING TOOL, CONNECT TO THE CABLE TO CONFIRM IT IS ABLE TO SUPPORT THE SPEEDS AND ETHERNET STANDARDS YOU ARE USING.

IT MAY NOT BE THE CABLE BUT WITH THE HARDWARE. MOVE TO A DIFFERENT PHYSICAL INTERFACE ON THAT SWITCH TO SEE IF THE PORT FLAPPING PROBLEM IS RESOLVED OR IF IT MOVES WHEN YOU MOVE THE CABLE.

IF THE FLAPPING IS RESOLVED WHEN YOU MOVE TO A NEW SWITCH PORT IT WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL SWITCH PORT ON THAT DEVICE.

IF THE FLAPPING CONTINUES THEN THE PROBLEM MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR DEVICE AND YOU MAY WANT TO CHANGE OUT OF YOUR COMPUTER OR THE NETWORK INTERFACE CARD ON YOUR DEVICE.
