Self-Assessment Sheet


Q1. What does virtualization technology allow us to do?
Ans: ALLOWS US TO RUN MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS ON (VMs) ONE SINGLE DESKTOP (DESKTOP, SERVER) AT THE SAME TIME.

Q2. What are examples of Virtualization Technology?
Ans. MACOS DESKTOP → WINDOWS 11, LINUX UBUNTU, OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY.

Q3. How does each individual operating system view their resources?
Ans: IT LOOKS LIKE THE OS HAS ITS OWN CPU, MEMORY, STORAGE - BUT IN REALITY ALL OF THESE OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE SHARING THE SAME HARDWARE ON YOUR SINGLE DEVICE.

VM TECHNOLOGY ENABLES EFFICIENT UTILIZATION OF HARDWARE RESOURCES BY DIVIDING THEM INTO ISOLATED AND INDEPENDENT ENVIRONMENTS.

(HYPERVISOR)

THE OS PERCEIVES ITS VIRTUALIZED RESOURCES ISOLATED AND DEDICATED UNAWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE OTHER VMS OR THE SHARING OF UNDERLYING PHYSICAL RESOURCES, ALLOWING INDEPENDENT MANAGEMENT OF ITS RESOURCES WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM THE OTHER OSs.

Q4. What type of virtualization is commonly found in a data center or enterprise environment?
Ans: VIRTUALIZATION ON DESKTOP → PRIMARY OS (MACOS FOR EX.) RUNNING OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS ON TOP.

VIRTUALIZATION ON SERVER → STANDALONE SERVER HOSTS MULTIPLE VIRTUAL MACHINES ON THAT HARDWARE.

SERVER VIRTUALIZATION IS COMMONLY FOUND IN DATA CENTER / ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTS. SERVER VIRTUALIZATION IS OFTEN IMPLEMENTED USING HYPERVISOR SOFTWARE.

Q5. How long has virtualization been around?
Ans: IT HAS BEEN IN USE SINCE THE 1960’s WITH IBM MAINFRAMES.

WE’VE TAKEN THIS IDEA AND MOVES IT INTO THE PC ENVIRONMENT, NOW ABLE TO VIRTUALIZE ACROSS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS.

Q6. What are some of the uses of virtualization?
Ans: USE LEGACY SOFTWARE ON AN OLDER OS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RUNNING THE LATEST OS ON YOUR DESKTOP.

OTHER USES :
SERVER VIRTUALIZATION
DESKTOP VIRTUALIZATION ^
NETWORK VIRTUALIZATION
STORAGE VIRTUALIZATION
APPLICATION VIRTUALIZATION
CLOUD COMPUTING
ETC.

Q7. What can you do with virtual machines?
Ans: YOU COULD RUN WINDOWS 10 ON ONE MACHINE, WINDOWS 11 ON ANOTHER, AND RUN DIFFERENT SOFTWARE IN EACH OF THESE OPERATING SYSTEMS.

OTHER :
RUN MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS
ISOLATE APPLICATIONS
TEST SOFTWARE
DEVELOP AND DEBUG SOFTWARE
SANDBOX ENVIRONMENTS
VIRTUAL LAB ENVIRONMENTS
SERVER CONSOLIDATION
ETC.


Q8. What is one example of how virtual machines can be helpful?
Ans: ^ THIS CAN BE HELPFUL IF YOU HAVE A VERY OLD / LEGACY TYPE OF SOFTWARE THAT WILL ONLY RUN ON SPECIFIC OPERATING SYSTEMS.

YOU WOULD CREATE A VM JUST FOR THAT OLDER OS AND RUN YOUR OLD SOFTWARE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RUNNING YOUR MODERN OS.

MORE EXAMPLES :
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
CYBERSECURITY AND MALWARE ANALYSIS.

Q9. What operating systems can be run on one single desktop?
Ans: YOU CAN RUN MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF OPERATING SYSTEMS ON ONE SINGLE DESKTOP.
MACOS PRIMARY → (VMS) → WINDOWS 10 PRO, WINDOWS 11 PRO
YOU CAN USE MACOS DESKTOP, AND RUN THINGS ON W11, AND RUN DIFFERENT SOFTWARE LIMITED TO ONLY W10.
(HOST OS → VIRTUAL MACHINES)

Q10. What does Virtualization as a technology allow us?
Ans. EFFICIENT RESOURCE UTILIZATION -

YOU CAN RUN MULTIPLE OSs AND MULTIPLE VERSIONS AS VIRTUAL MACHINES.

YOU CAN ALSO RUN DIFFERENT OSs AT THE SAME TIME.

OTHER : SERVER CONSOLIDATION, SIMPLIFIED IT MANAGEMENT, COST SAVINGS, ETC.


Q11. What are the advantages of virtualization?
Ans: RESOURCE EFFICIENCY -
YOU CAN USE ONE PHYSICAL DEVICE BUT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL STRENGTHS OF DIFFERENT OSs.

YOU DON’T HAVE TO CREATE DIFFERENT PARTITIONS OR REBOOT EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO USE A NEW OS.

OTHER: INCREASED SECURITY AND ISOLATION, SIMPLIFIED MANAGEMENT, COST SAVINGS, ETC.

Q12. : What is the purpose of virtualization?
Ans: WE CAN SIMPLY MOVE OUR MOUSE FROM ONE WINDOW TO ANOTHER AND USE THAT OS.

WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF TIME AND RESOURCES AND MONEY, NOT HAVING TO PURCHASE MULTIPLE DEVICES.

WE CAN SIMPLY USE OUR EXISTED DESKTOP TO RUN MANY DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS AT THE SAME TIME.

OTHER:
RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION ^
ISOLATION AND SECURITY
AGILITY AND FLEXIBILITY - CAN PROVISION, DEPLOY, SCALE VIRTUAL RESOURCES TO MEET BUSINESS DEMANDS QUICKLY.
SIMPLIFIED MANAGEMENT - SINGLE INTERFACE FOR ADMINS TO MANAGE TOOLS TO PROVISION, CONFIGURE, MONITOR, TROUBLESHOOT VMS / VIRTUALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE
ETC.

Q13. The software that’s able to keep track of our storage, our memory, our CPU, and everything else between all of these different virtual machines is called the __________.
Ans. HYPERVISOR

Q14. ___________________ really does describe exactly what the software is doing.
Ans. VIRTUAL MACHINE MANAGER (ANOTHER NAME REFERENCE)

Q15. We’re able to run multiple operating systems, but the memory, the storage, the networking, and everything else is managed as if it is its own _____________.
Ans. OPERATING SYSTEM

Q16. How do you ensure that your CPU is ready to be used with virtualization software?
Ans. IT’S NOT UNCOMMON FOR HYPERVISOR SOFTWARE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VIRTUALIZATION CAPABILITIES ALREADY IN YOUR SYSTEM.

FOR EXAMPLE : MANY CPUS HAVE HARDWARE-BASED VIRTUALIZATION BUILT INTO THE CPU ITSELF AND SOME HYPERVISORS REQUIRE THAT YOU’RE RUNNING THAT TYPE OF CPU.

YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE TO CHECK DOCUMENTATION OF YOUR SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE YOUR CPU IS READY TO BE USED WITH VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE.

ONCE THAT CAPABILITY IS ENABLED IN YOUR CPU, YOU CAN LOAD THE VIRTUALIZATION MANAGER WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE CPU, NETWORKING, SECURITY, ETC. BETWEEN THE VIRTUAL SYSTEMS.

Q17. What hardware is built into CPUs running on an Intel platform?
Ans.  IT IS CALLED VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY (VT)

Q18. What hardware is built into AMD CPUs for virtualization?
Ans.  AMD-V

Q19.What should be taken into consideration when planning to do virtualization on a desktop?
Ans:  YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOUR CPU SUPPORTS VIRTUALIZATION.

YOU WANT TO BE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF RAM.

YOU ALSO NEED ADEQUATE SPACE TO STORE THE VMs AND DATA.

(HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS)

OTHER : VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE, OS COMPATIBILITY, STORAGE CONSIDERATIONS ^, ETC.

Q20. How much memory do I need to run multiple VMs?
Ans:  EVERY OS IS GOING TO USE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MEMORY, SO YOU WOULD NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF RAM AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE VMS YOU PLAN TO RUN.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS : MEMORY ALLOCATION PER VM, TOTAL MEMORY (VM MEMORY + VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE / HYPERVISOR, ETC.), BALANCING RESOURCES ACROSS VMS, HOST SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, ETC.

Q21. What do you need to consider when creating a virtual machine?
Ans:  PURPOSE OF VM AND WORKLOAD IT WILL RUN → HARDWARE RESOURCES → MEMORY ALLOCATION, CPU ALLOCATION, STORAGE CONFIGURATION, NETWORKING SETUP
VIRTUALIZATION PLATFORM OR HYPERVISOR, AND MORE.

Q22. Why should you consider the amount of storage space when creating a virtual machine?
Ans: IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR A SINGLE OS TO REQUIRE MULTIPLE GBS OR STORAGE SPACE SO THERE NEEDS TO BE PLENTY OF ROOM ON THE STORAGE DEVICES TO BE ABLE TO INSTALL AND STORE ALL INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OS.

Q23. What should you configure when creating a virtual machine?
Ans:  THE VM WILL NEED TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER DEVICES ON THE NETWORK OR THE INTERNET, SO EACH GUEST OS SHOULD BE CONFIGURED WITH THE PROPER NETWORK CONFIGURATION.
(STANDALONE, NAT, BRIDGED, ETC.) (VIRTUAL SWITCH)

Q24. What is an example of how a developer might take advantage of a VM?
Ans: LEGACY SOFTWARE SUPPORT, COLLABORATION AND TEAM DEVELOPMENT, MULTI-PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT, ENVIRONMENT REPLICATION, ETC.

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT, TEST ENVIRONMENT ->

ISOLATION AND SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT - IN THE CONTEXT OF APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, VIRTUALIZATION IS A PERFECT RESOURCE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS BUILDING THEIR OWN APPLICATIONS. A DEVELOPER CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE THROUGH VM AS AN EXAMPLE THROUGH THE USE OF AN ISOLATED TESTING ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN LOAD ALL OF YOUR SOFTWARE THAT YOU ARE DEVELOPING ONTO A SINGLE VM BUT LIMIT ACCESS THAT VM MIGHT HAVE TO OTHER PARTS OF THE NETWORK OR TO PRODUCTION DATA.

THIS PROVIDES ISOLATION FROM THE HOST OS AND OTHER VMS. DEVELOPERS CAN CREATE SANDBOX ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN VMS ALLOWING THEM TO PERFORM VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT TASKS WITHOUT AFFECTING THE STABILITY OF THE HOST SYSTEM.

THEY WOULDN’T AFFECT THE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS SO THEY CAN TRY DIFFERENT THINGS SUCH AS MAKE CHANGES TO CODE, RUN THE CODE IN A VM, ANALYZE RESULTS.

Q25. What benefits does a Virtual Machine provide?
Ans: SEVERAL THAT WERE ALREADY DISCUSSED. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE HAVE A TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT WITH ISOLATED RESOURCES, LIMITING THE IMPACT OR STABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OR PRODUCTION / HOST SYSTEMS.

Q26. What is the ability of virtual machines?
Ans: THEY ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE SNAPSHOTS, SUCH AS FOR A VM CONFIGURATION IF WE WANT TO ROLLBACK AFTER MAKING CHANGES, ISSUES, ERRORS.

Q27. Working in a VM, especially a virtual machine that is exactly the same as a production network, is perfect for a ______________.
Ans.  DEVELOPER

Q28. What does the testing in a virtualized environment allow the developers?
Ans. THEY CAN REPLICATE PRODUCTION AND TESTING ENVIRONMENTS.

THEY CAN WRITE CODE IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS A MIRROR OF THE PRODUCTION.

WHEN THE APPLICATION IS FINISHED, THAT CAN BE MOVED INTO A VIRTUALIZED ENVIRONMENT FOR TESTING.

THIS WOULD ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO TEST IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS VERY CLOSE TO WHAT THE PRODUCTION NETWORK MIGHT BE WITHOUT HAVING IMPACT ON ANY OF THE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.

Q29. What is a major concern with running virtual environments?
Ans: HOW SECURE EACH OF THE VMS MAY BE FROM EACH OTHER SUCH AS:

VM ESCAPING - THIS IS WHEN MALWAYS MIGHT RUN ON AN EXISTING VIRTUAL MACHINE AND IT GAINS ACCESS SOMEHOW TO PARTS OF THE HYPERVISOR ITSELF.

Q30. What can happen once malware gains access to a hypervisor?
Ans: IT IS ABLE TO HOP TO ANY OF THE OTHER VIRTUALIZED SYSTEMS THAT ARE MANAGED BY THE HYPERVISOR.
IT RECOGNIZES IT’S ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE, IT COMPROMISES THE HYPERVISOR, AND JUMPS FROM ONE GUEST OS TO ANOTHER.

Q31. Have any vulnerabilities been identified in the past that allowed for VM escapes? Ans: YES, CERTAIN HYPERVISORS WERE IDENTIFIES WHERE A VM ESCAPE WAS PERFORMED. THEY WERE FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE ANY HACKER HAD A CHANGE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.
.
Q32. What security measures can be used to protect virtual machines?
Ans: HYPERVISOR SECURITY IS ONE WAY.

THERE IS ALSO HOST SECURITY, NETWORK SEGMENTATION, VM PATCHING AND UPDATES, VIRTUAL NETWORK SECURITY, DATA ENCRYPTION, AND MORE.

Q33. What is the potential danger of using hosted services for virtual machines?
Ans:IF SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO PERFORM A VM ESCAPE, THEY COULD GAIN ACCESS TO DATA FROM MANY DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS.

RUNNING AN OS AS A VM DOES NOT MAKE IT MORE SECURE, YOU NEED TO PROVIDE THE SAME SECURITY CONTROLS YOU WOULD FOR A PHYSICAL DEVICE RUNNING A SINGLE OS :

THINGS LIKE A HOST-BASED FIREWALL, ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE, AND MORE.

OTHER DANGERS : VENDOR LOCK-IN, LONG-TERM COST CONSIDERATION, LIMITED CONTROL AND CUSTOMIZATION, DEPENDENCY ON SERVICE PROVIDER, ETC.
IN THE CONTEXT HERE, DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY.

Q34. What should you be aware of when using someone else's virtual machine?
Ans: (SECURITY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS)
ANY VM THAT COMES FROM SOMEONE ELSE HAS POTENTIAL TO HAVE MALWARE INSIDE, SO IT IS BEST TO BUILD YOUR OWN VMs AND NEVER DOWNLOAD AND USE A VM FROM A THIRD-PARTY SOURCE.

LOOKING FOR AND DOWNLOADING PRE-INSTALLED VMS OVER THE INTERNET ARE RISKY IN THE SENSE YOU DON’T KNOW WHO CREATED IT AND WHAT SOFTWARE IT CONTAINS. ATTACKERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.

THERE ARE MORE THINGS SUCH AS END USER SUPPORT, EXIT STRATEGY AND DATA REMOVAL, PATCHING AND UPDATES, DATA PRIVACY / CONFIDENTIALITY, ETC.

Q35. What are some different ways to configure the networking between VMs?
Ans: THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. EVERY SINGLE VM HAS ITS OWN NETWORK CONFIG (VIRTUAL INTERNAL NETWORKS) AND YOU ON THE HYPERVISOR CAN DETERMINE HOW THE VM IS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE.
THERE IS VLAN, NAT, VIRTUAL SWITCH, BRIDGED NETWORKING, HOST-ONLY NETWORKING, INTERNAL NETWORKING, SDN, VPN, AND MORE.

ONE IS CHOOSING A SHARED NETWORK ADDRESS WHERE THE VM HAS THE SAME IP ADDRESS AS THE PHYSICAL HOST IT’S RUNNING ON. THIS (NAT) WILL ALLOW VMS TO SHARE A SINGLE IP ADDRESS FOR EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION. IT TRANSLATES PRIVATE IPs USED WITHIN THE VMs TO A SINGLE PUBLIC IP (HYPERVISOR) WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH THE EXTERNAL NETWORK.
-VM SHARES SAME IP AS PHYSICAL HOST
-USES PRIVATE IP ADDRESS INTERNALLY
-USES NAT TO CONVERT TO PHYSICAL HOST IP

ANOTHER IS USING A BRIDGED NETWORK ADDRESS CONFIGURATION (MORE TRADITIONAL).

Q36. What type of IP address does a virtual machine use?
Ans: A PRIVATE IP ADDRESS. IT WOULD USE NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION (NAT) TO COMMUNICATE USING THE IP ADDRESS OF THE HYPERVISOR.

Q37. How does a virtual machine obtain an IP address?
Ans: IN BRIDGED NETWORK ADDRESS CONFIGURATIONS, EVERY VM HAS ITS OWN IP ADDRESS. WHEN YOU START UP A VM, IT GOES THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS FOR OBTAINING AN IP ADDRESS AS ANY PHYSICAL DEVICE THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK. WHAT THIS MEANS IT EVERY VM HAS A DIFFERENT IP, OTHER DEVICES ON THE NETWORK ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE VM USING THAT UNIQUE IP, AND YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NAT OR THE HYPERVISOR DOING ANY TYPE OF TRANSLATION.

THIS ALLOWS FOR VMS TO BE SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED INTO THE EXISTING NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE.

-THE VM IS A DEVICE ON THE PHYSICAL NETWORK.

Q38. How can you lock down a VM so there is no communication outside of the local virtualized environment?
Ans: (IP ADDRESS CONFIGURATION)
BY CONFIGURING A PRIVATE ADDRESS.

IN THIS CASE YOU ARE NOT RECEIVING AN ADDRESS ON THE NETWORK.

YOU ARE NOT PERFORMING NAT.

INSTEAD THAT VM IS NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE OUTSIDE OF THE VIRTUAL NETWORK USED AMONG ALL OF THE OTHER VMS.

THERE ARE OTHER WAYS SUCH AS : VLANS (NETWORK SEGMENTATION), FIREWALL CONFIGURATIONS, DISABLING NETWORK ADAPTERS, ROUTING AND GATEWAY CONFIGURATIONS, DISABLING / RESTRICTING INTERNET ACCESS, AND MORE.

-PRIVATE ADDRESS - VM DOESN’T COMMUNICATE OUTSIDE OF VIRTUAL NETWORK.
