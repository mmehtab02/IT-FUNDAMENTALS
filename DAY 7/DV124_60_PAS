Q7. What is the function performed by the BIOS?
Ans. A MESSAGE YOU MIGHT SEE ON THE SCREEN WHILE BOOTING YOUR SYSTEM IS THAT THE DATE AND TIME IS EITHER INCORRECT OR HAS BEEN RESET. IT MAINTAINS THE DATE AND TIME THROUGH THE USE OF A BATTERY INSTALLED ON YOUR MOTHERBOARD.

Q8. What might happen if the battery has gone bad or all the voltage is depleted?
Ans: THE SYSTEM WILL NOT HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE DATE AND TIME IS AND YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY SET THAT EVERY TIME YOU START YOUR COMPUTER UNTIL YOU REPLACE THE BATTERY ON THE MOTHERBOARD.

Q9.What should you do if you start your computer and get a blank screen?
Ans. LISTEN TO THE BEEPS AND CROSSCHECK THE BEEP CODES FOR THAT MOTHERBOARD / MANUFACTURER TO KNOW WHICH DIRECTION TO GO TO HELP TROUBLESHOOT THIS PROBLEM.

Q10. How do you fix other problems like if the system tries to boot from a drive that is not the normal startup drive?
Ans. START YOUR BIOS CONFIG TO CHECK AND SEE WHICH BOOT DRIVES ARE LISTED IN WHICH ORDER, AND MOVE THEM AROUND OR REMOVE SOME FROM THE LIST TO FIX THIS ISSUE.

Q11. What do you need to do if you’ve left a USB drive plugged in and the USB drive attempts to boot prior to the primary storage drive?
Ans. REMOVE THE USB, RESTART YOUR COMPUTER, AND IT WILL BEGIN TO BOOT FROM THE NORMAL BOOT DRIVE.

Q12. What message will you get if something isn't working properly?

Q15. If this blue screen goes by very quickly and your system restarts, you can still go to the ____________________.
Ans. WINDOWS EVENT VIEWER

Q16. How can you view the information associated with a Windows stop error?
Ans: GO TO THE WINDOWS EVENT VIEWER / EVENT LOG

Q17. What is the Event Viewer useful for?
Ans: YOU CAN VIEW ALL THE INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE WINDOWS STOP ERROR. YOU CAN SEE WHAT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT TIME FRAME. THIS IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL IF YOU ARE VISITING A USER WHO HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM IN THE PAST.

Q18. The reference pages on Microsoft’s website give a lot of detail on how you can resolve specific issues.( True/ False)
Ans. FALSE

Q19. What should I do if my computer is displaying a blue screen error?
Ans: VIEW THE BASIC INFORMATION ON THE ERROR PAGE, VIEW THE EVENT LOG, CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER OF THE COMPUTER OR OF THE HARDWARE YOU INSTALLED CAUSING THE BLUE SCREEN ERROR.

THEY MAY BE ABLE TO USE THE DEBUG LOGS AND OTHER INFORMATION ON YOUR SYSTEM TO NARROW DOWN EXACTLY WHY THIS PROBLEM IS OCCURRING.

Q20. Which websites can you use to research more about the Blue Screen Error?
Ans. VISIT THE MICROSOFT WEBSITE WINDOWS.COM/STOPCODE, THEN USE THE STOP CODE THAT’S ON YOUR SCREEN TO FIND OUT MORE INFO ABOUT THE ERROR.

Q21.What are some potential causes of a blue screen?
Ans: IT COULD BE BAD HARDWARE, DRIVERS THAT AREN’T PROPERLY WORKING WITH THE OS, AN APPLICATION.

Q22. What will you do if your system is able to boot into Safe Mode but not able to boot into a full blown version of Windows?
Ans. IT CAN HELP NARROW DOWN WHERE THE PROBLEM IS SINCE SOME DRIVERS ARE LOADED DURING SAFE MODE AND OTHERS ARE NOT.

IF YOU INSTALLED NEW HARDWARE IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU CAN REMOVE AND RESEAT IT.

Q23. You can get a hardware diagnostics utility directly from the _____________.

Q26. What might happen when you see a spinning ball on your system and how to resolve it?
Ans: IT IS GIVING FEEDBACK THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING ON THE SYSTEM. WHATEVER IS HAPPENING HAS TO COMPLETE BEFORE YOU REGAIN ACCESS TO THE OS.

IN SOME CASES, IT MAY APPEAR FOR A MOMENT AND GO BACK TO NORMAL.

SOMETIMES THE SPINNING BALL WILL NEVER STOP AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE OS. IN THIS CASE, YOU HAVE TO COMPLETELY POWER DOWN THE SYSTEM AND POWER BACK ON TO BE ABLE TO LOG BACK INTO THE OS.

Q27. What might cause a spinning beach ball to appear on your system?
Ans: MANY REASONS - BUG IN AN APP, BAD HARDWARE, BAD MEMORY, IT COULD BE SLOW PAGING INFO OUT OF MEMORY TO THE STORAGE DRIVE OR BACK AGAIN.
EITHER WAY, YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PROCESS TO FINISH BEFORE THE BALL DISAPPEARS AND YOU GET YOUR CURSOR BACK IN THE OS.

Q28. What if the cursor never reappears and you have to restart your system?
Ans. GO TO THE CONSOLE LOGS IN MAC OS TO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND MORE INFO ABOUT WHY THIS PARTICULAR ERROR OCCURRED.


Q29. What should you check when the screen of a desktop computer stays black?
Ans: CHECK ALL OF THE CABLING (MONITOR POWER, VIDEO OUTPUT).


Q30. What are the possible inputs to a monitor?
Ans: HDMI, DVI, DISPLAYPORT, VGA, ETC.

CONFIGURE WHICH INTERFACE THE MONITOR IS USING AS INPUT.

Q31. How can you make a dim image on the screen brighter?
Ans: MONITORS MAY HAVE A BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST CONTROL. ADJUST THOSE TO SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE THE DIM IMAGE A LITTLE BRIGHTER.

Q32. What should you do if you see information on the screen but then everything goes black after Windows loads?
Ans: TELL WINDOWS TO START UP IN VGA MODE - BY USING VGA MODE YOU CAN TEST TO SEE WHETHER THE ISSUE IS WITH A DRIVER OR WITH THE MONITOR ITSELF.


Q33. __________________mode is able to work across almost every monitor on the market.
Ans. THIS (VGA MODE) IS A GENERIC GRAPHICS MODE (F8)

Q34. What tool can be used to check if an outlet is providing power to the power supply?
Ans. A MULTIMETER OR HANDHELD TESTER

Q35. What should you look for when determining if a computer is receiving power?
Ans: LOOK FOR ANYTHING INSIDE THE COMPUTER RECEIVING POWER.

EXAMPLE: FANS ARE SPINNING, BUT MOTHERBOARD IS INOPERABLE.

IS THE FAN CONNECTED TO THE POWER SUPPLY OR MOTHERBOARD? WHERE IS ITS SOURCE OF POWER?

IS THE POST FAILING? IS THE ISSUE OF POWER WITH THE MOTHERBOARD?

THIS ALLOWS YOU TO NARROW DOWN WHETHER IT IS AN ISSUE WITH YOUR POWER SUPPLY OR YOUR MOTHERBOARD.

Q36. What should we check to determine if there is a problem with the motherboard?
Ans: We should check the power-on self-test process to see if it identifies any problems during the startup.

Q37. The fans that are inside of your system need a lot of voltage to spin. ( True/ False).
Ans. False

Q38. How can I get an overview of my computer's performance?
Ans. To be able to get an overview of performance, you may want to start Task Manager and view the CPU utilization for each individual process. There’s also a Performance tab. And clicking that brings up a list of CPU utilization for all processes on your computer.

Q39. What could cause a system to become sluggish?
Ans: A PROBLEM WITH A PROCESS OR APPLICATION ^

A PROCESS BEHIND THE SCENES USING MORE RESOURCES THAN YOU EXPECT - FOR EX. WINDOWS UPDATE MIGHT CAUSE YOUR SYSTEM TO SLOW DOWN WITHOUT GIVING INFORMATION ABOUT.

STORAGE DRIVE FILLING UP

SYSTEM TEMP. RISING, CAUSING CPU TO SLOW DOWN

ANTI-VIRUS/MALWARE SOFTWARE RUNNING

POWER-SAVING MODE IN LAPTOPS THROTTLE CPU DOWN

ETC.

Q40. What can cause an operating system to perform poorly?
Ans: STORAGE DRIVE FILLING UP AND OS UNABLE TO WRITE FILES TO THAT DRIVE.

Q41. What happens if your desktop system’s temperature rises?
Ans: IT WILL ALSO BEGIN TO RUN THE CPU SLOWER SO YOUR SYSTEM IS ABLE TO COOL DOWN.

Q42. What components generate heat in a computer system?
Ans: EVERY COMPONENT INSIDE THE SYSTEM IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL HEAT GENERATED BY THE COMPUTER.

IT COULD BE CPUS, EXTERNAL VIDEO ADAPTERS, MEMORY MODULES, ETC.

Q43. How can you measure the temperature inside of a computer?
Ans: SOME DESKTOP SYSTEMS WILL MONITOR FOR TEMPERATURE AND PERFORM Q41.

OTHER MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE LIKE COOLING FANS THAT SPEED UP OR DOWN DEPENDING ON TEMPERATURE.

SOME BIOS/UEFI CONTAIN TEMPERATURE CHECKS.

YOU CAN USE THIRD-PARTY UTILITY SUCH AS HWMONITOR TO BE ABLE TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THE TEMPERATURE IS INSIDE YOUR COMPUTER.

Q44. Why should electronic components be cleaned?
Ans: TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE COOLING FUNCTION (FOR EXAMPLE HEAT SINKS) PROPERLY. DUST AND DIRT WILL AFFECT THE ABILITY OF YOUR SYSTEM TO REMAIN COOL.

Q45. What if your backside of the system has a lot of dust and produces a heat, how will you resolve this issue?
Ans. VACUUM ALL THE DUST TO REGAIN AIRFLOW THROUGH THE COMPUTER CASE.

Q46. What could be causing my computer to abruptly power down?
IT MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HEAT, IT COULD BE A SINGLE COMPONENT ON YOUR SYSTEM THAT IS FAILING AND CAUSING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TO ABRUPTLY SHUT DOWN.

YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE INFO IN DEVICE MANAGER, ESPECIALLY IF THE COMPONENT ISN’T WORKING PROPERLY.

YOU’LL WANT TO RUN A DIAGNOSTIC OF THE HARDWARE TO NARROW DOWN WHERE THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE.

BECAUSE YOU DON’T HAVE MUCH DATA ABOUT THE PROBLEM, YOU’D HAVE TO PERFORM A DETAILED DIAGNOSTIC AND REMOVE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE GOOD FROM THE EQUATION.

Q47. What should you do after eliminating items that are working properly?
Ans: MOVE FOCUS TOWARDS DEVICES THAT MAY NOT BE WORKING CORRECTLY AND PERFORM ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSTICS ON THOSE COMPONENTS.

Q48. What message might you receive when Windows has identified a problem?
Ans: WINDOWS EXPLORER HAS STOPPED WORKING - NO INFORMATION ON THE PROBLEM BUT IT IS IDENTIFIED.

IT MAY GIVE INFO, IT MAY NOT, THERE MAY BE NO ERROR MESSAGE - LOOK AT EVENT VIEWER FOR MORE DETAILS WHY AN APP HAS FAILED.

Q49. What is the Reliability Monitor?
Ans: A UTILITY INSIDE WINDOWS THAT TAKES ALL THE INFO SAVED IN YOUR EVENT VIEWER AND PROVIDES A GRAPHICAL OVERVIEW OF HOW YOUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN PERFORMING.

IT’LL BREAK DOWN DAY BY DAY HOW YOUR SYSTEM HAS PERFORMED.

IT SEPARATES OUT PROBLEMS INTO APP FAILURES, WINDOWS FAILURES, AND OTHER ISSUES.

Q50. What could be causing a scraping noise inside my system?
Ans: THE HARD DRIVE.

OTHER NOISES MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH FANS, COMPONENTS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY (ADAPTER CARD, HEAT SINK, ETC), SOMETHING LODGED IN THE FANS, ETC.
(CLICKING, RATTLING, GRINDING, SCRAPING)

Q51. What happens if a capacitor is damaged?
Ans: YOU MAY HEAR A POPPING NOISE.

CHECK THE CAPACITOR TO SEE IF IT HAS ANY BULGES ON THE TOP, OR COMPLETELY BLOWN OFF TOP.

Q52. : What is a very frustrating error that can occur in an operating system and how will you resolve that?
Ans: EVERYTHING SUDDENLY FREEZES - MOUSE, SCREEN DOESN’T CHANGE, NO ERROR MESSAGES.

LOOK FOR ANYTHING THAT STILL MAY BE RESPONDING - HARD DRIVE LIGHTS, OTHER STATUS LIGHTS, TRY TO HIT THE NUMBER LOCK BUTTON TO SEE IF IT TOGGLES ON / OFF, HIT CTRL ALT DLT TO SEE IF YOU CAN REGAIN ACCESS TO THE OS.

PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE OF NEW HARDWARE OR DRIVERS, IN THAT CASE REMOVE / UNINSTALL / REINSTALL THOSE COMPONENTS.

IT COULD BE LOW RESOURCES SUCH AS RAM / STORAGE, WHICH YOU WOULD NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES INSTALLED IN YOUR DEVICE.

HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS MAY BE HELPFUL.

Q53. What if you’ve recently installed a new driver or updated any part of your operating system?
Ans. (CONTINUOUS REBOOTS - BIOS OR OS?)

THIS MAY BE THE REASON FOR CONTINUOUS REBOOTS.

START WITH THE F8 KEY AND CHOOSE “BOOT FROM THE LAST KNOWN WORKING CONFIG”. THIS WILL REMOVE ANY CHANGES YOU MADE RECENTLY AND GO BACK TO THE LAST KNOWN GOOD LOGIN CONFIG.

ALSO TRY SAFE MODE SINCE ONLY A SUBSET OF DRIVERS ARE LOADED DURING SAFE MODE CONFIGURATION.

Q54.How can you prevent your computer from automatically restarting after a stop error or blue screen?
Ans: DISABLE AUTOMATIC RESTART IN SAFE MODE (F8) SO YOU HAVE TIME TO SEE THE ERROR AND DOCUMENT EVERYTHING ON THE SCREEN.

Q55. What is the best way to reset the BIOS configuration?
Ans: ON OLDER DEVICES, YOU CAN REMOVE THE CMOS BATTERY.

ON NEWER DEVICES, THE BIOS CONFIG IS WRITTEN TO FLASH MEMORY ON THE MOTHERBOARD.

TO RESET THIS YOU WOULD NEED TO SHORT A JUMPER AND RESTART YOUR SYSTEM.
