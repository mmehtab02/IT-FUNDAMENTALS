DV500_62_SAS_Troubleshooting Video and Display Issues
Self-Assessment Sheet


Q1. What could be the cause of no signal from a video display?
Ans: IT COULD BE THE CABLE ITSELF IS DISCONNECTED OR DAMAGED.

Q2. How can the issue  of no signal from a video display be resolved?
Ans: CHECK THE CONNECTIVITY AND RESEAT THE CABLES.

ALSO CHECK VIDEO INPUT SELECTORS TO SELECT THE RIGHT INTERFACE TO CONNECT TO, SUCH AS HDMI, DISPLAYPORT, DVI, VGA, ETC.

Q3. What should you do if the image on the display is very dim?
Ans: THERE ARE BUTTONS ON THE DISPLAY THAT ALLOW YOU TO CUSTOMIZE THE SETTINGS FOR BRIGHTNESS OR CONTRAST WHICH MAY BE THE ISSUE.

REPLACING THE MONITOR ITSELF MAY BE A WAY TO CHECK IF IT IS THE MONITOR ISSUE OR SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE CONFIGURATION OF IT.

Q4. What should you do if you are getting a black screen when you start the Windows operating system?
Ans: CHOOSE THE OPTION FOR VGA MODE (F8) WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO START WINDOWS IN A BASIC RESOLUTION MODE.

Q5. What might you be able to see on a display with a black screen?
Ans: IT MAY BE FLICKERING OR COLOR ISSUES INSTEAD OF A BLACK SCREEN. YOU WOULD WANT TO CHECK THE CABLE ITSELF FOR CONNECTION / DAMAGE.

Q6. What should you check if you're using a VGA connection?
Ans: CHECK THE INDIVIDUAL PINS ON THE CONNECTOR ITSELF.

Q7. How can I fix a distorted or misaligned display?
Ans: CHECK THE CONFIGURATION SETTINGS IN THE OPERATING SYSTEM.

YOU CAN CHANGE REFRESH RATES OR RESOLUTION SETTINGS TO SOMETHING MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THAT MONITOR.

Q8. What does the documentation for the monitors tell you?
Ans. IT WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT RESOLUTIONS AND REFRESH RATES ARE SUPPORTED BY THAT DEVICE.

Q9. What if your video adapter supports hardware acceleration?
Ans. TRY DISABLING THAT TEMPORARILY TO SEE IF THE DISPLAY ISSUES ARE RESOLVED.

Q10. What is a challenge when working with LCD displays?
Ans: THERE ARE A FIXED NUMBER OF PIXELS ON THE DISPLAY.

YOU NEED TO USE DISPLAY SETTINGS THAT MATCH THE PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION OF THE DISPLAY SINCE YOU DON’T HAVE A WAY TO MODIFY THE RESOLUTION OF THE DISPLAY SINCE THE PIXELS ARE FIXED.

Q11. What is the best way to get a sharp picture on an LCD display?
Ans: IF YOU CAN MATCH THE NATIVE RESOLUTION OF THAT DISPLAY YOU WILL HAVE THE SHARPEST PICTURE AVAILABLE ON THAT OUTPUT.

Q12. What does it mean when some letters are larger and more blocky than other letters in an output?
Ans: THAT CAN HAPPEN IF YOU DON’T MATCH THE RESOLUTION. THIS INDICATES THE WRONG RESOLUTION IS BEING USED AND WE NEED TO CHANGE IT TO MATCH THE CAPABILITIES OF THE MONITOR.

Q13. What should be done if you don't want to use the native resolution of a display?
Ans: USE ONE THAT IS A FACTOR THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THAT NATIVE RESOLUTION.


Q14. Give one example to describe this statement “ if you don't want to use the native resolution of a display” .
Ans. IF THE NATIVE RESOLUTION WAS 2560 BY 1600, YOU CAN USE 1920 BY 1200 BECAUSE IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME RATIO IN BOTH OF THESE RESOLUTIONS.

Q15. What is the problem of “burn-in”?
Ans: A PROBLEM THAT CAN OCCUR ACROSS ALL DISPLAY TYPES.

THIS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A SINGLE IMAGE ON THE SCREEN THAT STAYS FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND IT STAYS SO LONG THAT WHEN YOU REMOVE THAT IMAGE FROM THE SCREEN A PORTION / GHOST OF THAT IMAGE IS LEFT ON THE DISPLAY.

Q16. What is pixel-shift technology?
Ans: A TECHNOLOGY BUILT INTO SOME DISPLAYS THAT HELP PREVENT THE BURN-IN ISSUE.

IT WILL SLIGHTLY MOVE AN IMAGE THAT IS NOT CHANGED AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME BY JUST A PIXEL OR TWO IN EFFORT TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF BURN-IN. IT IS A VERY SLIGHT CHANGE AND YOU MAY NOT EVEN REALIZE THE DISPLAY IS MOVING.

Q17. On LCDs you may see this burn-in referred to as ____________.
Ans. IMAGE STICKING

Q18. How can you clean the screen from a stuck image?
Ans: DISPLAY A WHITE SCREEN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THIS IS EFFECTIVELY TRYING TO RESET THE IMAGE SO IT IS NO LONGER STUCK ON THE LCD.

Q19. What are dead pixels?
Ans: THESE ARE PIXELS ON A DISPLAY THAT HAVE NO COLOR AND ARE COMPLETELY BLACK. THIS CANNOT REALLY BE RESOLVED ON THE USER SIDE. THERE IS NO WAY TO GO INTO THE MONITOR AND SOMEHOW ENABLE THAT ONE PIXEL.

Q20. Is there a way to fix a dead pixel on an LCD monitor?
Ans: NO YOU CANNOT RESOLVE THE DEAD PIXEL. YOU WOULD NEED TO REPLACE THE LCD.

Q21. What causes flickering of the image?
Ans: THIS IS OFTEN CAUSED BY A LOOSE OR DAMAGED CABLE.

Q22. How do you fix a monitor that is flickering?
Ans: YOU CAN RESEAT THE CABLE OR REPLACE IT WITH A NEW CABLE.

Q23. What if there’s a difference between the capabilities of the monitor and what you’re sending to that monitor through the driver?
Ans. YOU MAY GET FLICKERING WITH THE OUTPUT.

THE FLICKERING CAN BE CAUSED BY A PROBLEM WITH THE MONITOR ITSELF OR SETTINGS OF YOUR VIDEO DRIVER AND MONITOR CONFIGURATION.

Q24. How can you fix the issue when the output that is shown is the wrong color?
Ans. LOOK AT THE CONFIGURATION OF THE MONITOR (TINT / CUSTOM COLOR PRESETS).

PERFORM A FACTORY RESET OF THE MONITOR’S CONFIGURATION.

CHECK THE CONFIGURATION INSIDE THE DRIVER OF THE OS. THERE MAY BE SETTINGS TO ADJUST TINTING / SPECIAL COLOR SETTINGS.

LASTLY CHECK THE OS TO SEE IF IT MODIFIES COLOR DEPENDING ON WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS.

Q25. Does the operating system modify the colors depending on the time of day?
Ans: YES - SOME OSs WILL DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF BLUE COLOR USED DURING THE NIGHTTIME HOURS BECAUSE IT CAN AFFECT SLEEP PATTERNS.

THE OS CAN HAVE NIGHTLIGHT OR EVENING SETTINGS AS WELL WHICH YOU CAN ENABLE / DISABLE.

Q26. What is important to know when using a monitor with built-in speakers?
Ans: WITH SPEAKERS BUILT INTO THE MONITOR AND PROBLEMS WITH THEM, WE WOULD ADJUST OUT DISPLAY TO RESOLVE IT.
THERE MAY BE CONTROLS FOR THE AUDIO ON THE MONITOR ITSELF AND YOU MAY BE ABLE TO INCREASE / DECREASE THE VOLUME ON THE PANEL.

IT’S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT’S FEEDING THAT AUDIO TO THE MONITOR ITSELF (SEPARATE AUDIO CABLE, INTEGRATED AUDIO INTO HDMI CONNECTOR, ETC.). YOUR MONITOR MAY HAVE A CONFIGURATION SETTING THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CHOOSE WHICH AUDIO INPUT IS USED FOR THE SPEAKERS BUILT IN THE MONITOR. THERE MAY BE MANY DIFFERENT AUDIO INPUTS (ANALOG, DIGITAL, INTEGRATED INTO VIDEO SIGNAL).

Q27. How can you adjust the brightness and contrast settings on a monitor?
Ans: CHECK THE BRIGHTNESS / CONTRAST SETTINGS ON YOUR MONITOR. YOU CAN MODIFY THE VALUES AND ADJUST THEM TO MATCH THE LIGHTING OF YOUR WORK AREA.

SOME ODs WILL AUTOMATICALLY DIM THE SCREEN DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF DAY OR BASED ON HOW MUCH POWER YOU HAVE IN YOUR BATTERY. THESE CONFIGURATIONS CAN BE MODIFIED IN THE DRIVER SETTINGS OR IN A SEPARATE DISPLAY CONFIGURATION APPLICATION.


Q28. What can cause a display to be black?
Ans: IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE THE DISPLAY BUT IT IS VERY DARK / SEEMS BLACK. YOU MIGHT HAVE BACKLIGHT FAILURE WHICH IS THE BACKLIGHT THAT SHINES LIGHT ON OUR LCD THROUGH THE DISPLAY SO WE CAN SEE INFO ON THE SCREEN.

Q29. What happens when the backlight fails and how will you resolve it?
Ans: IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MAKE ANYTHING OUT OF WHAT IS BEING DISPLAYED. SOME MONITORS ALLOW YOU TO REPLACE THE BACKLIGHT ON THE DISPLAY, OTHERWISE YOU MAY HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE DISPLAY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.

Q30. What is an LCD projector?
Ans: A METHOD TO DISPLAY INFORMATION OFTEN IN AREAS LIKE A CONFERENCE ROOM. THESE ARE COMMON IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE YOU NEED TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE VIEWING THE INFO ON ONE SINGLE SCREEN.

THESE DON’T NECESSARILY USE LCD TECHNOLOGY THOUGH.

-
Q31. Is the lamp inside projectors a hot light?
Q32. What kind of lamp is inside projectors?
Ans: YES, IT IS A VERY BRIGHT LAMP CONSISTING OF METAL HALIDE, AND IT TENDS TO BE VERY HOT.
-

Q33. Why is it a best practice to leave the fan running when you turn off an LCD projector?
Ans: THE FAN ALLOWS THE LAMP TO COOL DOWN SLOWLY AND EXTEND THE LIFETIME OF IT. THESE LAMPS CAN BE EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE.

Q34. What should you do if the LCD projector intermittently shuts down and goes completely black but the fan continues to run?
Ans: THERE MAY BE A COOLING PROBLEM. CHECK THE COOLING VENTS ON THE LCD PROJECTOR AND MAKE SURE THE FAN INSIDE IS BLOWING AIR THROUGH THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. IF THERE IS ANY PROCESS WITH THIS COOLING PROCESS THE SENSORS INSIDE WILL THE LCD PROJECTOR WILL RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS GETTING TOO HOT AND WILL AUTOMATICALLY TURN IT OFF TO PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE.

Q35. How can I improve the airflow in my projector?
Ans: REMOVING BLOCKAGES OR CLEANING OUT ANY DUST OF THE PROJECTOR.

SOME PROJECTORS HAVE AIR FILTERS BUILT INTO THEM AND YOU MAY NEED TO REPLACE THOSE FILTERS TO HAVE BETTER AIRFLOW.
