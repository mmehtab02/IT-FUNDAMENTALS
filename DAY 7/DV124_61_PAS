DV500_61_SAS On Troubleshooting Storage Devices
Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. What does it mean when you see a message on the screen that says, "Cannot read from the source disk"?
Ans:  THIS INDICATES A PROBLEM READING OR WRITING INFORMATION TO THE STORAGE DRIVE. IT COULD INDICATE THE STORAGE DRIVE HAS FAILED. IT COULD BE THE STORAGE DRIVE IS STILL WORKING BUT YOU ARE GETTING A SLOW RESPONSE.

Q2. What is the "click of death"?
Ans: IF YOU ARE USING A HARD DRIVE AND IT IS MAKING A LOUD CLICKING NOISE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS INDICATES THE DRIVE IS FAILING OR MAY HAVE ALREADY FAILED.

Q3. What should be done first when troubleshooting storage problems?
Ans: MAKE A BACKUP OF ALL CRITICAL DATA IF POSSIBLE.

Q4. How can I check if my system is overheating?
Ans: OVERHEATING AFFECTS ALL COMPONENTS IN THE SYSTEM. ERRORS ON THE DRIVE MAY BE RELATED TO THIS. IT CAN BE A NEW HARDWARE COMPONENT OR OVERLOADING OF THE POWER SUPPLY. PERHAPS NOT ENOUGH VOLTAGE FOR THE DRIVE.

Q5. What can a user do if their power supply does not have enough power for a storage drive?
Ans: REMOVE THE HARDWARE SO YOU HAVE ENOUGH POWER FOR THE DRIVE OR UPGRADE THE POWER SUPPLY.

Q6. What if you’re not sure if the problem is with the drive or something outside of the storage drive?
Ans. RUN SOME HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS OF THE DRIVE ITSELF.

Q7. What can the drive manufacturer provide to check the working components of a drive?
Ans: A SET OF DIAGNOSTICS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHETHER THE DRIVE IS OPERATING PROPERLY OR IF THERE ARE ANY ERRORS.

Q8. What messages may occur when you boot your system?
Ans: DRIVE NOT RECOGNIZED
BOOT DEVICE NOT FOUND

Q9. What lights may occur when you boot your system?
Ans: LIGHTS THAT SHOW ACCESS TO THE DRIVE
PERHAPS NO LIGHTS SHOWING ACCESS TO THE DRIVE.

Q10. What does it mean when an operating system is not found during startup?
Ans: THE DRIVE IS THERE BUT FOR SOME REASON WE ARE NOT ABLE TO FIND AN OPERATING SYSTEM INSTALLED ON THE DRIVE.

Q11. What is the first step to troubleshoot this issue when an operating system is not found during startup?
Ans. CHECK THE PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION SUCH AS CABLES.


Q12. The ____________maintains the list of priorities for all of the boot devices during startup.
Ans. BIOS

Q13. What is the sequence for booting up in a BIOS?
Ans: THE BOOT PRIORITY, CHECKING THE TOP OF THE LIST (IN THIS CASE STORAGE DRIVE) AND FINDING AN OS, IF NOT FOUND MOVING ONTO THE NEXT BOOT DEVICES IN THE LIST.

Q14. What should I check if my system is not booting?
Ans: USB INTERFACES, BOOT PRIORITY LIST, CHECK BIOS CONFIG IF STORAGE DEVICES ARE ENABLED IN BOOT LIST.

Q15. What should you do if you are booting from a new storage drive?
Ans: CHECK THE DATA AND POWER CABLES (PHYSICAL INSTALLATION).

OTHER OPERATIONAL SATA INTERFACES ON YOUR MOTHERBOARD.

TRY THE DRIVE IN ANOTHER COMPUTER AS WELL.

Q16. What is a potential problem with hard drives?
Ans: THEY ARE SPINNING MECHANICAL SYSTEMS. IT’S NOT A QUESTION OF IF A HARD DRIVE WILL FAIL BUT WHEN IT WILL FAIL.

YOU MAY HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TO RECOVER DATA FROM SPECIALIZED COMPANIES, AND AT TIMES THE DRIVE WILL BE UNRECOVERABLE.

Q17. What can happen if a solid state drive fails?
Ans: YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO READ OR WRITE ANY DATA TO THAT DRIVE.

BUT SOME SSDS CAN FAIL AND STILL ALLOW YOU TO READ DATA, BUT NOT WRITE.

Q18. What does RAID stand for?
Ans. REDUNDANT ARRAY OF INDEPENDENT DISKS.

Q19. What is RAID?
Ans: A COMMON WAY TO COMBINE DRIVES TOGETHER TO MAINTAIN UPTIME AND AVAILABILITY OF YOUR DATA.

Q20. How do you investigate a RAID controller failure?
Ans: THE BOOT UP PROCESS MAY GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY INTEGRATED RAIDS, PROBLEMS WITH IT, AND MORE, AS WELL AS AN OPTION FOR STARTING A CONFIGURATION UTILITY (IN THIS CASE DELL) TO INVESTIGATE AND GET MORE INFO ABOUT THE RAID CONTROLLER FAILURE.

Q21. What can a RAID manager tell you?
Ans: IT CAN LIST OUT ALL THE DRIVES IN THE SYSTEM, TELL THE TYPES OF MODELS OF THE DRIVES, AND GIVE A STATUS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL DRIVES IN THE RAID ARRAY.

IF ANY DRIVE FAILS OR HAS AN ERROR, IT WILL BE NOTED IN THE STATUS AND YOU WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHICH DRIVES.

Q22. How many drives is required in RAID 0?
Ans. TWO OR MORE.

Q23. What happens if a single drive failure occurs in a RAID 0 array?
Ans: IT WILL BREAK THE ARRAY AND YOU WILL HAVE DATA LOSS.

Q24. How many drives do you need for RAID 1?
Ans:TWO OR MORE.

Q25. What is the minimum number of drives required for RAID 5?
Ans: THREE OR MORE.

Q26. RAID 10, which you may see written as______________, requires _________________ drives.
Ans. RAID 1 + 0
4 OR MORE

Q27. What is the full form of SMART?
Ans: SELF-MONITORING, ANALYSIS, REPORTING TECHNOLOGY.

Q28. What information is provided in SMART data?
Ans: AMAZING AMOUNT OF DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION INSIDE EACH STORAGE DRIVE USING THIS STANDARD.

THIS INFORMATION CAN BE ACCESSED FROM THIRD-PARTY UTILITIES OR UTILITIES FROM THE DRIVE MANUFACTURER AS WELL :

SPIN-UP TIME, SEEK ERROR RATES, POWER ON HOURS, ETC.

Q29. How often will Mini RAID arrays perform their own checks?
Ans: EITHER ONCE A DAY, WEEK, OR MONTH.

Q30. What should be done when receiving a message that a drive is failing?
Ans: BACK UP THE DATA AND REPLACE THE DRIVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

Q31.What are the different parts of your computer system that can be used to retrieve or store the data?
Ans: MANY DIFFERENT PARTS - MEMORY ACCESS, COMMUNICATION ACROSS THE BUS, THE DRIVE ITSELF, DIFFERENT STORAGE MEDIA.

Q32. What are some ways to measure the overall performance of our storage devices?
Ans. IOPS - A VERY BROAD PERSPECTIVE OF HOW WELL WE ARE ABLE TO READ AND WRITE DATA TO THE DRIVE, BUT IT AT LEAST GIVES A STANDARD TO USE ACROSS MULTIPLE DRIVES AND SYSTEMS.

MOST DRIVE DIAGNOSTICS GIVE STATISTICS IN IOPS.

Q33. IOPS stands for?
Ans. INPUT/OUTPUT OPERATIONS PER SECOND

Q34. How much IOPS can a hard drive achieve?
Ans: 200 IOPS

Q35. What is the IOPS of a solid state drive?
Ans: ONE MILLION IOPS.

Q36. How can we troubleshoot when certain drives are missing from the File Manager? Ans: CHECK THE BIOS

IF IT ISN’T THERE, IT COULD BE CABLE OR RESEATING ISSUE (PHYSICAL)

IT COULD BE THE DRIVE ITSELF HAS FAILED.

Q37. If this is an external drive that’s connected via USB, then we want to be sure we have_____________ for the drive and that we’re connecting to the appropriate __________interface.
Ans. POWER
USB

Q38. How do we reconnect a missing network share?
Ans:
IF THE MISSING DRIVE IS A NETWORK SHARE, WE MAY HAVE MISSED THE DRIVE BEING MOUNTED DURING THE STARTUP PROCESS.

WE HAVE THE OPTION TO RECONNECT THAT DRIVE ONCE WE MAKE THAT CONNECTION.

WE MAY WANT TO RUN THE LOGIN SCRIPT AGAIN THAT WILL GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF MAPPING THE APPROPRIATE DRIVES.
