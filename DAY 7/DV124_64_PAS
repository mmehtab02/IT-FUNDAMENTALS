Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. How can you test if a printer is working properly?
Ans. USING A TEST PAGE FEATURE THAT’S BUILT INTO WINDOWS, EITHER IN THE WINDOWS SETTINGS OR IN THE PROPERTIES OF THE PRINTER ITSELF.

PRINT A TEST PAGE BUTTON.

THIS WILL CONFIRM YOUR WINDOWS CONFIG IS CORRECT AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN YOUR DEVICE AND THE PRINTER IS WORKING PROPERLY.


Q2. How do you send a test page to the printer?
Ans: GO TO WINDOWS SETTING OR PROPERTY OF PRINTER AND USE PRINT TEST PAGE BUTTON WHICH WILL SEND A MESSAGE TO THE PRINTER TO DO SO.

Q3. : What are some ways to diagnose a printer issue?
Ans: TEST FUNCTIONS BUILT INTO THE PRINTER CONSOLE.

LOG INTO THE PRINTER THROUGH A CONSOLE TO PERFORM TESTS.

VENDOR UTILITIES OR THIRD-PARTY UTILITIES ON THE INTERNET THAT CAN HELP WITH OTHER PRINTING FUNCTIONS.

Q4. What if you look at the test page and the output does not look how you would expect it to be?
Ans. YOU WILL WANT TO RESEARCH WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM.

Q5. What do you do if you have a line that goes all the way down the page on an inkjet printer?
Ans: CLEAN THE PRINT HEADS OR REPLACE THE PRINT HEADS.

Q6. What do you do if you have a line that goes all the way down the page on a laser printer?
Ans: IT IS PROBABLY A SCRATCH ON THE PHOTOSENSITIVE DRUM. REPLACE THIS DRUM, WHICH MAY INVOLVE REPLACING THE TONER CARTRIDGE.

Q7.Why is the output on the page very light or difficult to read?
Ans: THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH THE TONER (LASER) OR THE INK (INKJET).

Q8. What could cause items that you print on one part of the page to show up later on down the page?
Ans: IT COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH THE CLEANING PROCESS IN A LASER PRINTER. THIS WILL CREATE A GHOST / SHADOW OF INFO THAT YOU HAD PREVIOUSLY PRINTED ON THE EARLIER DRUM ROTATION.


Q9. What does a scratched photosensitive drum look like?
Ans: TONER WILL STICK TO THE SCRATCH AND GETS TRANSFERRED TO THE PRINTED PAGE.

THIS CAUSES A LINE GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE PAGE.

Q10. What happens when toner sticks to the scratch?
Ans: TONER WILL STICK TO IT AND GET TRANSFERRED TO THE PAGE.


Q11. What is a symptom of a problem associated with the cleaning process on a laser printer?
Ans: YOU MIGHT HAVE A NORMAL PART OF THE PAGE ON THE TOP, BUT YOU WILL SEE PARTS OF THAT PAGE REPEATED LATER ON DOWN THE PAGE.

Q12. What can cause garbled print?
Ans: PRINTED PAGE WITH A LOT OF STRANGE CHARACTERS ON IT.

IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF A BAD PRINTER DRIVER, OR WRONG MODEL PRINTER IN YOUR CONFIGURATION.

OFTEN YOU ARE ON A PCL PRINTER SENDING IT AS POSTSCRIPT, OR VICE VERSA.

Q13. How do you check if an application is printing to the correct printer model?
Ans: RUN A TEST PRINT IN THE CASE OF GARBLED PRINT SO IT WILL PRINT WHAT IT NORMALLY EXPECTS. CHECK THE APPLICATION YOU ARE USING TO SEE IF IT IS PRINTING TO THE CORRECT PRINTER MODEL. YOU MAY NEED TO CHANGE THE PRINTER DRIVER OR JUST THE CONFIG OF THE EXISTING PRINTER DRIVER TO MATCH THE CONFIG OF THE PRINTER.

Q14. What happens when you touch part of the output from a laser printer?
Ans: THE OUTPUT WILL SMUDGE. THE TONER HAS NOT BEEN FUSED PROPERLY TO THE PAPER.

Q15. What could be causing a printer to not produce any output?
Ans: THE FUSER ASSEMBLY IS EITHER NOT HEATING UP OR NOT WORKING PROPERLY INSIDE THE PRINTER. THESE ARE RELATIVELY EASY TO REPLACE AND HAVE HOOKS KEEPING IT IN PLACE. YOU CAN REMOVE THE HOOKS, SLIDE THE ASSEMBLY OUT, REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE, AND LOCK IT IN PLACE.

Q16. What happens if you send output to the printer that is expecting a different sized page?
Ans: THE PRINTER WILL STOP AND GIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE THAT THERE IS A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE PAGE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PRINT AND THE PAPER THAT HAPPENS TO BE INSTALLED IN THE PRINTER.

Q17. What message will you get if the paper size installed in the printer tray is incorrect?
Ans: AN ERROR MESSAGE ON THE SCREEN SAYING YOU NEED A CERTAIN SIZE OF PAPER INSTALLED INTO A PARTICULAR TRAY OF THE PRINTER. THAT WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO REPLACE THE PAPER IN THE TRAY AND CONTINUE WITH THE PRINTING PROCESS. IN THESE CASES YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MODIFY THE CONFIG OF YOUR DEVICE SO IT MATCHES THE CONFIG OF THE PRINTER.

Q18. What should you do if the paper gets stuck in the printer?
Ans: REMOVE THE PAPER FROM THE PRINTER WHILE BEING CAREFUL NOT TO RIP ANY PART OF THE PAPER TO LEAVE PIECES INSIDE THE PRINTER.

Q19. What might cause issues with the printer?
Ans: IF THERE IS A PROBLEM PICKUP UP A PAGE AND SENDING IT THROUGH THE PRINT CYCLE, OR PICKING UP MULTIPLE PAGES AT THE SAME TIME AND SENDING THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY.

CHECK THE PRINT TRAY ITSELF FOR ANY DAMAGE AND GOOD WORKING ORDER.

ALSO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE PICKUP ROLLERS.

Q20. How can I fix rollers that are worn or damaged?
Ans: YOU WILL WANT TO REPLACE THEM INDIVIDUALLY OR REPLACE THEM ALL AS A PART OF A MAINTENANCE KIT.

Q21. What could be causing my pages to come out creased?
Ans: THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH SOMETHING ALONG THE PAPER PATH OR YOU MAY BE USING THE WRONG WEIGHT OF PAPER.

CHECK THE DOCUMENTATION FOR YOUR PRINTER TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TYPE AND WEIGHT OF PAPER IS OPTIMAL FOR YOUR SYSTEM.

Q22. What can cause the entire print queue to crash?
Ans: A PARTICULAR PRINT JOB (CORRUPTED). THESE CORRUPTED PRINT JOBS CAN CAUSE THE ENTIRE PROCESS TO STOP WHICH WILL CAUSE MULTIPLE PRINT JOBS TO BE ADDED TO THE QUEUE BUT NOTHING PRINTING.

Q23. How does the print spooler service address this issue?
Ans: THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FOR THE PRINT SPOOLER SERVICE TAKES THIS PROBLEM OF PRINT QUEUE CRASHES INTO ACCOUNT.

IF IT FAILS THE FIRST TIME IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY RESTART THE PRINT SPOOLER SERVICE.

THE SECOND TIME IT WILL RESTART.

Q24. What will happen if the print spooler service fails multiple times?
Ans: IT WILL CAUSE THE SERVICE TO HAVE NO ACTION WHICH MEANS IT WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY RESTART.

Q25. What can you do if the print spooler has crashing issues?
Ans: THERE MAY BE INFORMATION IN YOUR WINDOWS EVENT VIEWER THAT CAN HELP YOU TROUBLESHOOT.

LOOK FOR EVENTS TAGGED WITH WINDOWS PRINT SERVICE OPTION.

THIS WILL GIVE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE CRASH AND THE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS.

IT COULD BE A SINGLE PRINT JOB CAUSING THESE ISSUES AND DELETING IT WILL HAVE THE PRINT SPOOLER UP AND RUNNING AGAIN.


Q26. What is a challenge with color printers?
Ans: YOU MAY WANT THE PRINTER TO PROVIDE EXACTLY THE SAME COLORS YOU’RE SEEING ON YOUR SCREEN.

THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR DESIGNERS FOR EXAMPLE AS THEY WANT THE PRINTED OUTPUT TO LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVERYTHING DESIGNED ON THE SCREEN.

Q27. What is the first step to calibrating a screen and printer?
Ans: YOU CAN CALIBRATE THE SCREEN WITHOUT ADDITIONAL TOOLS.


Q28. What is the best way to calibrate a screen?
Ans: HAVING A THIRD PARTY CALIBRATION TOOL MAKES THE PROCESS EASY AND YOU KNOW THE FINAL OUTPUT WILL BE ACCURATE.

Q29. What type of paper should be used for screen calibration?
Ans: A BRIGHT WHITE PAPER CAN BE USED FOR PRINTER COLOR CALIBRATION.

Q30. What is a calibration tool?
Ans: IT IS A TOOL BUILT INTO THE PRINTER OR INCLUDED IN SECONDARY UTILITY THAT PROVIDES EXACTLY THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF INK / TONER TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT WHAT’S ON THE SCREEN.

IT WILL PROVIDE AN ACCURATE OUTPUT.

Q31. How do we use a calibration tool?
Ans: IT CAN BE A SECONDARY UTILITY OR A BUILT IN TOOL ON THE PRINTER.

Q32. What does a color calibration do?
Ans: YOU CAN COMPARE COLORS ON THE SCREEN WITH THE COLOR OUTPUT FROM YOUR PRINTER TO MAKE SURE IT IS PROPERLY CALIBRATED FOR THE BEST COLOR OUTPUT.

Q33. What could be causing grinding noises from my printer?
ANS: IT COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH THE MECHANISMS INSIDE THE DEVICE.

IT COULD BE A PAPER JAM, OR RELATED TO THE CARRIAGE IN AN INKJET PRINTER NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE ACROSS THE PAGE BACK AND FORTH.

Q34. What should I do if I hear grinding noises from my printer?
ANS: RUN A HARDWARE DIAGNOSTIC ON THE PRINTER OR EVALUATE THE PRINTER PATH AND REMOVE JAMMED ITEMS.

CHECK THE DOCUMENTATION FOR YOUR PRINTER TO KNOW THE EXACT PROCESS TO FOLLOW.

YOU MAY NEED TO BRING A THIRD PARTY TO PROVIDE REPAIR WITH ADDITIONAL PARTS.

YOU MAY NEED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE PRINTER. OR IT MAY BE A SIMPLE FIX.

IT COULD BE SOMEONE DIDN’T INSTALL THE INK CARTRIDGES PROPERLY AND REPLACING THOSE WILL SOLVE THE ISSUE.

Q35. What are some of the enhanced capabilities of office printers?
Ans: AN EXAMPLE IS FINISHING THAT OCCURS WITH THE OUTPUT. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE CREATED THE OUTPUT TO ADD ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE WE MIGHT HAVE OUR PRINTER COLLATE THE PAGES OR BIND THE PAGES TOGETHER.

Q36. Does the printer have a stapler built in?
Ans: YES, IT MAY.

Q37. How is the location of the holes determined?
Ans: The location of the holes is determined by the configuration of the print driver.

Q38. What should you check if the output is different?
Ans: If the output is different, you may want to check the print driver and confirm that you put the right settings in and that they match the configuration of the printer.

Q39. What if you print something in portrait, and it ends up printing in landscape or vice versa?
Ans. In those scenarios, we’re not getting the right orientation for the page. And so we’ll need to troubleshoot where the problem happens to be occurring. It may be that the printer is following the directions of the print driver, and the wrong option is being selected during the printing process.

Q40. What might be the cause of a printer not printing in the correct orientation?
Ans: IT MAY BE THE PRINT DRIVER HAS A BUG AND WE NEED TO UPDATE IT TO PROPERLY PRINT IN PORTRAIT OR LANDSCAPE.

THE DEFAULT SETTING COULD ALSO BE THE CAUSE OF WRONG PRINT ORIENTATION. IF YOU DON’T SPECIFY ANY, IT WILL CHOOSE THE DEFAULT. YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT SETTING ON THE PRINTER ITSELF.
