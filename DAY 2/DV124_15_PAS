15_SAS On IPv4 and IPv6
Self-Assessment Sheet
1. How many bits are in an IPv4 address?
32 BITS
2. How many bits are in an IPv6 address?
128 BITS
3. What are the first 64 bits in an IPv6 address?
IPV6 ADDRESSES TEND TO BE ASSIGNED WITH A 64BIT SUBNET MASK.
THE FIRST 64 BITS ARE THE NETWORK ADDRESS.
4. What are the second 64 bits in an IPv6 address?
THE LAST 64 BITS ARE THE HOST ADDRESS.
5. What is the highest possible digit/number for each byte in an IPv4 address?
THE MAX POSSIBLE VALUE IS 255.
6. What settings to check when troubleshooting IPv4?
CHECK THE IP ADDRESS CONFIGURATION TO SEE THAT IT HAS A VALID IPV4 ADDRESS, SUBNET MASK, DEFAULT GATEWAY, AND DNS SERVER SETTINGS.
CHECK FOR ANY PHYSICAL CONNECTION ISSUES ON THE NETWORK INTERFACE SUCH AS LOOSE CABLES AND DISABLED NETWORK ADAPTERS.
CHECK FOR IP ADDRESS CONFLICTS AND MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO DUPLICATES. RELEASING AND RENEWING THE IP ADDRESS OR ASSIGNING A STATIC IP TEMPORARILY CAN BE DONE TO TROUBLESHOOT.
VERIFY THE IP ADDRESS OF THE DEFAULT GATEWAY (ROUTER) AND MAKE SURE IT IS REACHABLE AND CONFIGURED PROPERLY. THE DEFAULT GATEWAY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTING TRAFFIC BETWEEN DIFFERENT NETWORKS.
CHECK THE DNS SERVER SETTINGS AND MAKE SURE THE DEVICE IS USING THE PROPER DNS SERVER ADDRESSES. THIS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSLATING DOMAIN NAMES INTO IP ADDRESSES. IF THE DNS SERVER SETTING ARE INCORRECT IT CAN RESULT IN INABILITY TO ACCESS WEBSITES OR RESOLVE DOMAIN NAMES.
YOU CAN ALSO CHECK FIREWALL / SECURITY SETTINGS BY MAKING SURE THE NECESSARY PORTS AND PROTOCOLS ARE ALLOWS FOR NETWORK COMMUNICATION. DISABLING THE FIREWALL TEMPORARILY CAN BE DONE FOR TROUBLESHOOTING TO HELP IDENTIFY IF IT IS CAUSING PROBLEMS.
THE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY CAN BE VERIFIED BY PINGING THE DEFAULT GATEWAY OR OTHER DEVICES ON THE LOCAL NETWORK. THIS CAN HELP FIGURE OUT OF THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE OF CONNECTION ISSUES BETWEEN DEVICES.
ROUTING ISSUES MAY BE A PROBLEM IF THE DEVICE IS A PART OF A LARGER NETWORK AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE ROUTERS. VERIFY THE ROUTING CONFIGURATION. CHECK IF THE CORRECT ROUTES ARE SET UP TO REACH THE PROPER DESTINATION NETWORK.
NETWORK SERVICES / APPLICATIONS CONFIGURATION SETTINGS CAN BE CHECKED IF THEY ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY. MAKE SURE THE REQUIRED PORTS, PROTOCOLS, AND SETTINGS ARE CONFIGURED PROPERLY FOR THE SERVICE / APPLICATION.
NETWORK HARDWARE SUCH AS SWITCHES, ROUTERS, ACCESS POINTS, MAY BE AT FAULT. CHECK THEIR FUNCTIONALITY, POWER, ETC. RESETTING OR POWER-CYCLING THESE DEVICES SOMETIMES HELPS RESOLVE CONNECTION PROBLEMS.
7. What is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)?
A NETWORK PROTOCOL THAT ENABLES DEVICES TO OBTAIN IP ADDRESSES AND OTHER NETWORK CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS AUTOMATICALLY. IT SIMPLIFIES THE PROCESS OF ASSIGNING AND MANAGING IP ADDRESSES WITHIN A NETWORK BY CENTRALIZING THE ALLOCATION OF IP ADDRESSES AND RELATED SETTINGS, REDUCING MANUAL ADMINISTRATION.
THE CLIENT SENDS A DHCP REQUEST AND THE DHCP SERVER RESPONDS WITH AN IP ADDRESS AND SETTINGS FROM A PREDEFINED POOL. THESE ARE ALLOCATED DYNAMICALLY AND ARE LEASED FOR A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME AFTER WHICH THEY WOULD BE RELEASED, AND THEN REASSIGNED. THIS DYNAMIC ALLOCATION FITS WELL WITH THE NATURE OF NETWORKS AS PEOPLE CONNECT AND DISCONNECT OFTEN.
THE OTHER CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS ASSIGNED TO DEVICES WOULD INCLUDE SUBNET MASK, DEFAULT GATEWAY, DNS SERVER ADDRESSES, AND OTHERS.
DHCP SERVERS ALLOW FOR CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT ON A DHCP SERVER, AND DHCP RELAY IN LARGE NETWORK SETTINGS TO FORWARD INFORMATION BETWEEN CLIENTS AND DHCP SERVERS.
THERE IS ALSO THE CONCEPT OF ADDRESS CONFLICT DETECTION THAT AVOIDS DUPLICATE IP ADDRESS ASSIGNMENT, AND DHCP RENEWAL AND REBINDING WHICH RENEWS A LEASE OF AN ASSIGNED IP ADDRESS TO A CLIENT OR REBINDS CLIENT DEVICES TO OBTAIN LEASE EXTENSIONS FROM OTHER AVAILABLE DHCP SERVERS IF ONE DHCP SERVER DOESN’T RESPOND OR THE LEASE EXPIRES.
8. What port does a device use to broadcast to DHCP server?
UDP PORT 67
9. What port does DHCP server use to broadcast to a device?
UDP PORT 68
10. What is a subnet mask?
A SUBNET MASK IS USED BY THE LOCAL DEVICE TO DETERMINE WHAT SUBNET IT IS A PART OF. IT ISN’T USUALLY TRANSMITTED ACROSS THE NETWORK.
THIS IS A 32-BIT VALUE (IPV4) USED IN IP NETWORKING TO DIVIDE THE IP ADDRESS INTO THE NETWORK AND HOST PORTIONS. THESE WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH IP ADDRESSES TO DETERMINE THE NETWORK AND HOST COMPONENTS OF AN IP COMMUNICATION.
THE SUBNET MASK HELPS IDENTIFY WHICH PART OF AN IP ADDRESS IS THE NETWORK AND WHICH PART IS THE HOST.
THE SUBNET MASK CONTAINS A SEQUENCE OF CONSECUTIVE 1S FOLLOWS BY CONSECUTIVE 0S.
THE LENGTH OF 1ST DETERMINES THE NETWORK PORTION OF THE IP ADDRESS. THIS DEFINES THE BOUNDARIES OF THE NETWORK AND IDENTIFIES DEVICES WITHIN THE SAME NETWORK SEGMENT.
THE CONSECUTIVE 0S (REMAINING PORTION) REPRESENTS THE HOST PORTION. THIS IDENTIFIES A SPECIFIC DEVICE WITHIN THE NETWORK AND ALLOWS FOR UNIQUE ADDRESSING OF INDIVIDUAL DEVICES.
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS LIKE :
SUBNETTING - DIVIDING A LARGE NETWORK INTO SMALLER SUBNETWORKS / SUBNETS. THE SUBNET MASK WOULD DEFINE THE BOUNDARIES AND SIZE OF EACH SUBNET. THIS CAN BE ADJUSTED BY NETWORK ADMINS AS PER REQUIREMENT.
NETWORK ROUTING - ROUTERS USE THE SUBNET MASK TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE PATHS FOR ROUTING IP PACKETS. WHEN A ROUTER EXAMINES THE SUBNET MASK OF A DESTINATION IP, IT CAN DETERMINE IF THE DESTINATION IS WITHIN THE SAME NETWORK OF IF IT NEEDS TO BE FORWARDED TO ANOTHER NETWORK.
CIDR NOTATION - CLASSLESS INTER-DOMAIN ROUTING NOTATION REPRESENTS AN IP ADDRESS AND ITS ASSOCIATED SUBNET MASK. FOR EXAMPLE : 192.168.1.0/24 REPRESENTS :
IP ADDRESS - 192.168.1.1
SUBNET MASK - 24 BITS SET TO 1 (NETWORK WITH 24 BITS FOR THE NETWORK PORTION)


MORE EXAMPLES OF SUBNET MASKS ARE :

255.255.255.0 (OR /24) - UP TO 254 HOST ADDRESSES IN NETWORK SEGMENT.
FIRST 3 OCTETS (8X3=24 BITS) ARE SET TO 1 WHICH IS THE NETWORK PORTION. THE LAST OCTET (8 BITS) IS SET TO 0 WHICH IS THE HOST PORTION.
THIS CAN BE USED IN SMALL - MEDIUM SIZED NETWORKS.

255.255.0.0 (OR /16) - UP TO 65,534 HOST ADDRESSES IN A NETWORK SEGMENT.
FIRST 2 OCTETS (8X2=16 BITS) ARE SET TO 1 WHICH IS THE NETWORK PORTION. THE LAST 2 OCTETS (16 BITS) ARE SET TO 0, THE HOST PORTION.
THIS CAN BE USED IN MEDIUM SIZED NETWORKS.

255.255.255.128 (OR /25) - UP TO 126 HOST ADDRESSES.
FIRST 3 OCTETS (8X3=24) SET TO 1 WHICH IS NETWORK PORTION.
LAST OCTET (8 BITS) HAS FIRST 7 SET TO 1, AND LAST BIT SET TO 0, REPRESENTING HOST PORTION.
USED IN SMALLER NETWORKS OR WHEN SUBNETTING A LARGE NETWORK INTO SMALLER SUBNETS.

255.255.255.252 (OR /30) - ALLOWS FOR ONLY 2 HOST ADDRESSES.
FIRST 3 OCTETS (8X3=24 BITS) SET TO 1 WHICH IS NETWORK PORTION.
LAST OCTET (8 BITS) HAS FIRST 6 BITS SET TO 1 AND LAST 2 BITS SET TO 0, REPRESENTING HOST PORTION.
USED FOR POINT TO POINT LINKS OR WHEN CONSERVING IP ADDRESSES IN A NETWORK FOR USE.

SUBNET MASKS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN IP ADDRESSING, NETWORK SEGMENTATION, AND ROUTING WITHIN IP NETWORKS.
11. What is default gateway?
AN IP ADDRESS OF A ROUTER WHICH ALLOWS FOR COMMUNICATION OUTSIDE OF YOUR LOCAL SUBNET. THIS MUST BE AN IP ADDRESS ON THE LOCAL SUBNET.
THE DEFAULT GATEWAY (DEFAULT ROUTER) IS A NETWORK DEVICE / NODE THAT SERVERS AS AN ENTRY POINT OR EXIT POINT FOR TRAFFIC BETWEEN NETWORKS. THIS IS THE BRIDGE / GATEWAY BETWEEN LOCAL NETWORKS AND EXTERNAL NETWORKS, LIKE THE INTERNET.
