Self-Assessment Sheet
1. How to assign IPv4 IP addresses for Private IP?
YOU WOULD NEED TO MANUALLY CONFIGURE THE IP ADDRESSES ON THE DEVICE(S) OR USE A DHCP SERVER TO ASSIGN ADDRESSES FROM A SPECIFIC PRIVATE IP ADDRESS RANGE :
CLASS A : 10.0.0.0 TO 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
CLASS B : 172.16.0.0 TO 172.1.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
CLASS C : 192.168.0.0 TO 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
THESE PRIVATE IP ADDRESS RANGES ARE RESERVED AND DESIGNATED TO USE WITH PRIVATE NETWORKS.
CHOOSE AN IP ADDRESS RANGE THAT FITS THE NUMBER OF DEVICES ON YOUR NETWORK.
DETERMINE THE SUBNET MASK TO DEFINE THE NETWORK AND HOST PORTION OF THE IP ADDRESS. COMMON SUBNET MASKS FOR PRIVATE IP ADDRESSES ARE :
CLASS A : 255.0.0.0 (OR /8)
CLASS B : 255.255.0.0 (OR /16)
CLASS C : 255.255.255.0 (OR /24)
       3)   ASSIGN SPECIFIC IP ADDRESSES TO DEVICES ON YOUR NETWORK, WHICH CAN BE DONE     MANUALLY BY CONFIGURING NETWORK SETTINGS ON EACH DEVICE OR BY USING A DHCP SERVER TO DYNAMICALLY ASSIGN IP ADDRESSES.
PUBLIC IP ADDRESSES SHOULD AVOID BEING USED IN PRIVATE NETWORKS TO PREVENT CONFLICTS. THIS PRIVATE NETWORK SHOULD NOT BE ACCESSIBLE OR ROUTABLE FROM THE PUBLIC INTERNET.

2. What is the process of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?
THE DHCP PROCESS INCLUDES A FOUR STEP PROCESS THAT IS REFERRED TO AS DORA.
THE FIRST STEP IS THE DISCOVER STEP. OUR CLIENT WILL TRY TO LOCATE A DHCP THAT IS ON THE LOCAL NETWORK.
THE SECOND STEP IS OFFER WHERE THE DHCP SERVER WILL OFFER AN IP ADDRESS TO THE CLIENT.
THE THIRD STEP IS THAT OUR CLIENT WILL LOOK AT THE OFFER(S) RECEIVED, PICK, AND LOCK INTO THIS OFFER BY REQUESTING FOR THAT IP ADDRESS FROM THE DHCP SERVER.
THE FOURTH STEP IS THAT THE DHCP SERVER WILL ACKNOWLEDGE / CONFIRM THAT OFFER AND PROVIDE THE CLIENT WITH ALL OF THE IP CONFIGURATION SETTINGS THAT IT NEEDS.

IN THE DISCOVER STEP, THE CLIENT WILL SEND A BROADCAST OF DISCOVERY TO UDP PORT 67. THIS BROADCAST WILL GO THROUGH THE SWITCH TO A DHCP SERVER AND ROUTER WITH DHCP RELAY ENABLED (IP HELPER), AND THAT ROUTER WILL ROUTE TO ANOTHER DHCP SERVER. MULTIPLE SERVERS ARE PRESENT FOR REDUNDANCY. IT IS BROADCASTED TO ALL DEVICES ON THE LOCAL NETWORK. ROUTERS TYPICALLY DO NOT ALLOW BROADCASTS TO PASS, BUT IN THIS CASE IT HAS A DHCP RELAY ENABLED / CONFIGURED AS DHCP PROXY.
BOTH DHCP SERVERS RECEIVED THE REQUEST. NOW FOR STEP 2 THESE SERVERS WILL SEND THE OFFERS BACK TO THE CLIENT WORKSTATION TO A BROADCAST ADDRESS OVER UDP/68. THE REASON SO MANY BROADCASTS ARE BEING USED IT BECAUSE THE CLIENT DOES NOT HAVE AN IP ADDRESS YET.
NOW THE CLIENT EXAMINES THE OFFERS AND MAKES A DECISION ON WHICH OFFER IT SHOULD TAKE FOR THE IP ADDRESS ASSIGNMENT. IT WILL NOW SEND A BROADCAST OVER UDP/67 FOR THE 3RD STEP / REQUEST PHASE. THIS BROADCAST / REQUEST IS A FORMAL REQUEST TO TAKE THE OFFER ORIGINALLY SENT. IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE CLIENT COMMUNICATES WITH THE DHCP SERVER MAKING THE ORIGINAL OFFER (SWITCH CONNECTED TO DHCP SERVER). BUT THIS IS A BROADCAST, SO THE DATA IS ALSO SENT TO THE OTHER DEVICES ON THIS LOCAL SUBNET.
NOW THAT THE DHCP HAS RECEIVED THE FORMAL REQUEST, IT BEGINS STEP 4 / THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT PHASE WHERE IT SENDS A MESSAGE BACK TO THE CLIENT OVER UDP/68, CONFIRMING THE REQUEST FROM THE PREVIOUS PHASE / STEP HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED. THE DEVICE CAN NOW ASSIGN ITSELF WITH THE CONFIGURATION SETTINGS FROM THE OFFER.
3. What is the result of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?
THE CLIENT IS PROVIDED AN IP ADDRESS, SUBNET MASK, DEFAULT GATEWAY, DNS SERVER, ETC. AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT THE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE DHCP PROCESS.
4. Features of Static IP address?
5. Features of Dynamic IP address?
-
THIS 4 STEP PROCESS OF DORA HAPPENS EVERY TIME A DEVICE CONNECTS TO A NETWORK AND NEEDS TO OBTAIN AN IP ADDRESS FROM A DHCP SERVER.
WHEN THE DHCP SERVERS WERE INITIALLY CONFIGURED, IT WAS PROVIDED A RANGE OF IP ADDRESSES TO HAND OUT TO CLIENTS. THIS IS REFERRED TO AS A POOL OF IP ADDRESSES.
AN IP ADDRESS THAT YOU PULL TO A CLIENT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT ONE DAY FROM ANOTHER DAY, BUT THERE ARE CASES WHERE DEVICES ON YOUR NETWORK PREFER TO RECEIVE THE SAME IP ADDRESS EVERY TIME IT STARTS UP, SUCH AS SERVERS, PRINTERS, ETC.
BY DEFAULT DHCP USES THIS IP ADDRESS POOL TO ASSIGN IP ADDRESSES DYNAMICALLY TO CLIENTS.
TO SETUP A DEVICE TO ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME IP ADDRESS, YOU CAN DISABLE DHCP ON THESE DEVICES. THE IP ADDRESS INFORMATION CAN BE MANUALLY CONFIGURED, BUT THIS REQUIRES ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES. IT WOULD NEED TO BE VISITED MANUALLY TO MAINTAIN WHEN THERE ARE CHANGES.
THERE IS A BETTER METHOD FOR GETTING STATIC IP ADDRESSES ESPECIALLY IN LARGE NETWORK ENVIRONMENT.
YOU CAN CONFIGURE AN IP RESERVATION ON THE DHCP SERVER AND WHAT THIS DOES IS ASSOCIATES A SPECIFIC MAC ADDRESS WITH AN IP ADDRESS. EVERY TIME YOU CONNECT THESE DEVICES TO THE NETWORK, IT WILL HAVE THE SAME IP ADDRESS.
MANAGING THE DEVICES WILL ALSO BE EASIER BECAUSE YOU ARE USING THE DHCP SERVER TO ASSIGN THESE STATIC IP ADDRESSES. YOU DON’T NEED TO VISIT EACH OF THE DEVICES.

6. What is Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA)?
THIS IS A FALLBACK MECHANISM / TEMPORARY SOLUTION THAT HELPS DEVICES MAINTAIN LIMITED CONNECTIVITY IN A LOCAL NETWORK / SEGMENT WHEN IT FAILS TO OBTAIN AN IP ADDRESS FROM A DHCP SERVER. THE IPV4 APIPA RANGE IS 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255 WITH THE FIRST AND LAST BEING RESERVED (TECHNICALLY RANGE IS 169.254.1.0 - 169.254.254.255).
THIS IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS A LINK-LOCAL ADDRESS BECAUSE ANY DEVICE CONFIGURED WITH AN APIPA ADDRESS CAN ONLY COMMUNICATE TO OTHER DEVICES IN THE LOCAL NETWORK / SEGMENT. IT CANNOT COMMUNICATE OUTSIDE OF THIS NETWORK.
JUST LIKE DHCP, APIPA ADDRESSES ARE AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED BUT IT IS DONE BY YOUR LOCAL DEVICE. IT PICKS AN IP ADDRESS IN THE RANGE ABOVE, PERFORMS AN ARP (ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL) REQUEST TO CHECK IF ANY OTHER DEVICES ON THE NETWORK ARE USING THIS IP ADDRESS, AND PROCEEDS TO ASSIGN THAT IF THERE IS NO ADDRESS CONFLICT.
IN THE IPCONFIG/ALL EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE WHEN THERE IS AN APIPA ADDRESS ASSIGNED, AND THERE IS NO DEFAULT GATEWAY SINCE COMMUNICATING OUTSIDE YOUR LOCAL NETWORK ISN’T POSSIBLE.
7. What is unicast addresses?
BROADCAST IP ADDRESS SCHEMING IS USED TO SEND A BROADCAST MESSAGE TO ALL DEVICES ON A NETWORK / SEGMENT SIMULTANEOUSLY. ALL DEVICES WOULD PROCESS THAT MESSAGE. ROUTERS DO NOT FORWARD BROADCAST MESSAGES UNLIKE WE DEFINED SPECIFICALLY THAT THE ROUTER IN THE EXAMPLE EARLIER WAS CONFIGURED AS A DHCP PROXY / DHCP RELAY WAS ENABLED.
THE ADDRESS WOULD BE AN IP ADDRESS AND IT WILL BE A SPECIAL ADDRESS WHERE A BROADCAST MESSAGE IS SENT.
IN THE CASE OF UNICAST ADDRESSES, IT WILL BE ONE DEVICE SENDING A MESSAGE TO ANOTHER SPECIFIC DEVICE AND ONLY THAT DEVICE WILL PROCESS AND RECEIVE THE MESSAGE. THIS IS POINT TO POINT COMMUNICATION. ROUTERS CAN ROUTE THESE UNICAST PACKETS TO THE APPROPRIATE UNICAST ADDRESS ON THE APPROPRIATE NETWORK PATH.
8. What is multicast addresses?
MULTICAST COMMUNICATION INVOLVES SENDING A MESSAGE TO A SPECIFIC GROUP OF DEVICES. THIS IS ONE TO MANY OR MANY TO MANY COMMUNICATION. THESE MULTICAST MESSAGES ARE SENT TO A MULTICAST ADDRESS AND IS RECEIVED BY ALL DEVICES THAT ARE A PART OF THIS MULTICAST GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ADDRESS.
DEVICES JOIN A MULTICAST GROUP BY SUBSCRIBING TO A SPECIFIC MULTICAST ADDRESS.
MULTICAST ALLOWS FOR SINGLE MULTICAST MESSAGES TO REACH ALL MEMBERS OF A MULTICAST GROUP, RATHER THAN SENDING MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL UNICAST MESSAGES, AND RATHER THAN BROADCASTING TO THE ENTIRE NETWORK / NETWORK SEGMENT. THIS ALLOWS FOR EFFICIENT NETWORK USAGE.
9. What is anycast addresses?
THIS IS REFERRING TO THE ADDRESSING IN NETWORKING WHERE THE MESSAGE / PACKET IS SENT TO THE NEAREST OR BEST AVAILABLE DESTINATION OUT OF A GROUP OF DEVICES OFFERING THE SAME SERVICE. THIS ANYCAST MESSAGE IS INTENDED FOR ONE DEVICE BUT THAT DEVICE CAN BE IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS.
THIS IS ALSO ONE TO ONE COMMUNICATION AND SIMILAR TO UNICAST MESSAGING, BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THE SAME DEVICE FOR THE SPECIFIC SERVICE MAY BE IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS.
ROUTING PROTOCOLS DETERMINE THE BEST PATH TO REACH THE NEAREST ANYCAST INSTANCE, AND BEST PATHS ARE TYPICALLY FOUND WITH THE USE OF ROUTING TABLES.
10. What is BootP?
THE LAST VIDEO SPOKE OF MANUAL IP ADDRESS CONFIGURATION WHICH INCLUDED THE IP ADDRESS, SUBNET MASK, DEFAULT GATEWAY, AND DNS SERVER SETTING. THERE ARE OTHER POSSIBLE IP CONFIGURATIONS AS WELL.
IN AN ENTERPRISE NETWORK WHERE YOU HAVE DOZENS, HUNDRED, THOUSANDS OF DEVICES THIS MANUAL CONFIGURATION PROCESS IS NOT SUITABLE FOR THIS ENVIRONMENT.
IN OCTOBER 1993 A PROTOCOL WAS CREATED THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN IP ADDRESSES TO DEVICES. THIS IS CALLED THE BOOTSTRAP PROTOCOL, OR BOOTP.
BUT IT DID NOT ASSIGN ALL OF THE IP ADDRESS CONFIGURATION SETTINGS, AND THERE WAS STILL A NEED FOR MANUAL CONFIGURATION. IT ALSO DID NOT KNOW WHEN A DEVICE LEFT THE NETWORK SO THE IP ADDRESS COULD BE USED FOR ANOTHER DEVICE.
TO CORRECT THE SHORTCOMINGS OF BOOTP, WE UPGRADED THIS TO A NEW VERSION AND CALLED IT THE DHCP PROTOCOL.
