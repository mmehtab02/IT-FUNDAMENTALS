18_SAS ON DHCP Configuration
Self-Assessment Sheet
What is an IP Scope?
A scope is generally a single contiguous pool of IP addresses. Subnets have their own scope.
AN IP SCOPE IS A LARGE RANGE OF IP ADDRESSES THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO A DHCP CLIENT BY THE DHCP SERVER. IT CAN INCLUDE EXCLUDED ADDRESSES AS WELL.
YOU WILL NEED A SUBNET MASK FOR THIS IP ADDRESS RANGE.
YOU CAN DEFINE LEASE DURATIONS IN THE SCOPE PROPERTIES AS WELL WHICH IS HOW LONG THE CLIENT CAN HOLD ONTO THE SAME IP ADDRESS.
THERE ARE OTHER SCOPE OPTIONS SUCH AS DNS SERVER SETTINGS, DEFAULT GATEWAY SETTINGS, AND IF YOU ARE USING FOR EXAMPLE A VOICE OVER IP SERVER, YOU CAN ADD THE IP ADDRESS OF THE VOIP GATEWAY.
 How do you exclude certain IP addresses?
THIS EXCEPTION CAN BE CREATED UNDER DHCP SERVER SETTINGS. THIS MEANS THAT CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES ARE EXCLUDED FROM BEING ASSIGNED TO CLIENTS ON THE NETWORK.
What is a Scope of a subnet?
A scope is generally a single contiguous pool of IP addresses. Subnets have their own scope.
SIMILAR TO THE IP SCOPE THAT YOU PROVIDE IN THE DHCP SERVER SETTINGS, YOU CAN ADD A SUBNET POOL SUCH AS 192.168.1.0/24. IN THIS CASE YOUR DHCP SERVER WOULD ASSIGN CLIENTS IP ADDRESSES IN THIS SUBNET, RANGING FROM 192.168.1.1 TO 192.168.1.254 (254 MAX HOST ADDRESSES).
192.168.1.0 REPRESENTS THE NETWORK ADDRESS AND 192.168.1.255 REPRESENTS THE BROADCAST ADDRESS AND THESE ADDRESSES ARE RESERVED.
What is address leases within a scope?
List of IP addresses under DHCP server settings that have been previously assigned.
IT IS A LIST OF ADDRESSES WITHIN AN IP SCOPE THAT ARE LEASED OUT OR PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO CLIENT DEVICES. THIS CAN BE CONFIGURED AND VIEWED BASED ON THE SCOPE AND DURATION.

ADDRESS LEASE DURATIONS CAN BE SET WHICH IS HOW LONG THE CLIENT CAN HOLD ONTO THE SAME IP ADDRESS WITHIN A SCOPE / SUBNET.
 What are reservations within a scope?
List and configuration to reserve IP addresses to a specific device in DHCP server settings.
IF YOU WANT A DEVICE CONNECTING TO A NETWORK TO ALWAYS RECEIVE THE SAME IP ADDRESS (SUCH AS PRINTERS), YOU CAN CONFIGURE A DHCP ADDRESS RESERVATION. ANOTHER DEVICE ON THE NETWORK CANNOT OBTAIN THIS SPECIFIED IP ADDRESS.

THE SCOPE REFERS TO THE IP ADDRESS RANGE THAT IS ASSIGNED TO CLIENTS ON THE NETWORK. THE DHCP SERVER WILL ONLY ASSIGN IP ADDRESSES WITHIN THIS RANGE TO DEVICES ON THE NETWORK.
THE DHCP ADDRESS RESERVATION IS CONFIGURED BASED ON THE MAC ADDRESS. EVERY DEVICE HAS A UNIQUE MAC ADDRESS.

OTHER TERMS FOR THIS IS IP RESERVATION, STATIC ASSIGNMENT, STATIC DHCP, OR STATIC DHCP ASSIGNMENT.
 What are Scope options?
Additional parameters in DHCP server settings like IP address of VOIP gateway.
THESE ARE THE DHCP CONFIGURATION OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THIS INCLUDES :

AN IP SCOPE IS A LARGE RANGE OF IP ADDRESSES THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO A DHCP CLIENT BY THE DHCP SERVER.
IT CAN INCLUDE EXCLUDED ADDRESSES AS WELL.
YOU WILL NEED A SUBNET MASK FOR THIS IP ADDRESS RANGE.
YOU CAN DEFINE LEASE DURATIONS IN THE SCOPE PROPERTIES AS WELL WHICH IS HOW LONG THE CLIENT CAN HOLD ONTO THE SAME IP ADDRESS.
THERE ARE OTHER DNS SETTINGS AS WELL.
THERE ARE DEFAULT GATEWAY SETTINGS.
THERE ARE SETTINGS FOR OTHER DEVICES LIKE VOIP SUCH AS VOIP GATEWAY.
 What is a dynamic assignment?
WHEN USING IP RESERVATION, WE ARE ASSIGNING STATIC IP ADDRESS VALUES TO A DEVICE BASED ON ITS MAC ADDRESS.

THE OTHER DEVICES AND THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FOR EVERY OTHER DEVICE IS DYNAMIC ASSIGNMENT.

THIS MEANS THAT A CLIENT CONNECTING TO A NETWORK IS ASSIGNED AN IP ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN ITS POOL RANGE BY THE DHCP SERVER DYNAMICALLY, THAT WAY WHEN THE LEASE TIME EXPIRES IT CAN BE WITHDRAWN BACK TO THE POOL AND YOU CAN RECEIVE A NEW IP ADDRESS FROM THE POOL IF YOU DECIDE TO RECONNECT AFTER LEASE EXPIRATION.

THIS IS A TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT. AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME (LEASE DURATION) THE DEVICE MUST CHECK IN WITH THE DHCP SERVER TO LET IT KNOW IT IS STILL USING THAT IP ADDRESS ON THE NETWORK, OTHERWISE THE LEASE TIME WILL EXPIRE.
 What happens after the lease period has timed out?
THE IP ADDRESS THAT WAS LEASED OUT IS RETURNED TO THE DHCP SERVER AND IT CAN BE ASSIGNED TO OTHER CLIENTS.
What is address reservation?
IF YOU WANT A DEVICE CONNECTING TO A NETWORK TO ALWAYS RECEIVE THE SAME IP ADDRESS (SUCH AS PRINTERS), YOU CAN CONFIGURE A DHCP ADDRESS RESERVATION. ANOTHER DEVICE ON THE NETWORK CANNOT OBTAIN THIS SPECIFIED IP ADDRESS.

THE SCOPE REFERS TO THE IP ADDRESS RANGE THAT IS ASSIGNED TO CLIENTS ON THE NETWORK. THE DHCP SERVER WILL ONLY ASSIGN IP ADDRESSES WITHIN THIS RANGE TO DEVICES ON THE NETWORK.

THE DHCP ADDRESS RESERVATION IS CONFIGURED BASED ON THE MAC ADDRESS. EVERY DEVICE HAS A UNIQUE MAC ADDRESS.

OTHER TERMS FOR THIS IS IP RESERVATION, STATIC ASSIGNMENT, STATIC DHCP, OR STATIC DHCP ASSIGNMENT.
What is a DHCP lease?
DHCP ADDRESS LEASE ARE LEASE DURATION TIMINGS THAT CAN BE SET WHICH IS HOW LONG THE CLIENT CAN HOLD ONTO THE SAME IP ADDRESS WITHIN A SCOPE / SUBNET.

SOME DHCP SERVERS DEFINE THE LEASE TIME IN SECONDS, SUCH AS SOHO DHCP SERVERS (ROUTER).

AFTER THE LEASE TIME EXPIRES, THAT IP ADDRESS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ANOTHER PERSON AND YOU MAY BE ASSIGNED ANOTHER IP ADDRESS.
What is automatic assignment?
A FEATURE IN DHCP SERVERS THAT KEEPS A LIST OF EVERYONE WHO WAS PREVIOUSLY CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK.

IF YOU RECONNECT TO THE NETWORK AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AWAY, IT WILL REMEMBER YOUR PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENT.

IF THAT IP ADDRESS IS STILL AVAILABLE, IT WILL ASSIGN YOU THE IP ADDRESS YOU ORIGINALLY HAD.

DHCP ADDRESS RESERVATION TAKES THIS A STEP FURTHER.
What is the amount of time on a lease?
DHCP ASSIGNS AN IP ADDRESS TO A CLIENT FROM A POOL OF ADDRESSES FOR A LIMITED PERIOD KNOWN AS THE LEASE TIME.

THIS IS THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE CLIENT CAN USE THE IP ADDRESS BEFORE THE LEASE EXPIRES.

THE AMOUNT OF TIME IN A LEASE IS DETERMINED BY THE CONFIGURATION OF THE DHCP SERVER, AND YOU CAN CHANGE THIS AS PER YOUR REQUIREMENT.

THE RECOMMENDED LEASE TIME IS 48 HOURS SO THAT EVERY 24 HOURS IT CAN RENEW THE LEASE WITH THE T1 TIMER.

What is the T1 timer?
ADDITIONAL TIMER THAT AIDS IN LEASE RENEWAL. THIS TIMER CHECKS IN WITH THE DHCP SERVER 50% INTO THE LEASE TIME. IF THE LEASE TIME WAS 8 DAYS, IT WILL CHECK INTO THE DHCP SERVER AFTER 4 DAYS TO LET IT KNOW IT WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THE IP ADDRESS FOR ANOTHER LEASE DURATION. THE TIMER THAN RESETS TO 8 DAYS AND STARTS COUNTING DOWN AGAIN.
What is the T2 timer?
    Timer that rebinds with any DHCP server at 87.5% of the lease time when the original DHCP server is down.
IN THE CASE THE ORIGINAL DHCP SERVER IS DOWN, THE LEASE TIME CONTINUES TO COUNT DOWN. WHEN IT REACHES 7/8TH OR 87.5% OF THE LEASE TIME, IT WILL TRY REBINDING WITH ANOTHER REDUNDANT DHCP SERVER SO THAT THIS IP ADDRESS CAN BE RETAINED ON THE CLIENT DEVICE.
THIS IS LIKE A BACKUP LEASE RENEWAL PROCESS IN CASE THE ORIGINAL DHCP SERVER IS NOT AVAILABLE.
IN THE EXAMPLE OF 8 DAYS, IF THE T1 TIMER DOES NOT SUCCEED IN COMMUNICATING WITH THE ORIGINAL DHCP SERVER, AFTER 7 DAYS IT WILL COMMUNICATE WITH A REDUNDANT DHCP SERVER TO RENEW THE LEASE, STARTING THE LEASE BACK TO DAY 1.


Asif khan DV-500 Day-3 SLV-18 Q&A DHCP Configuration
Q1. What are DHCP scope properties?
A. A DHCP scope is a valid range of IP addresses that are available for assignment or lease to
client computers on a particular subnet. In a DHCP server, a scope is configured to determine
the address pool of IPs that the server can provide to DHCP clients. Scopes determine which IP
addresses are provided to the clients.
Q2. What are DHCP pools?
A. Address pool is a set of Internet Protocol addresses available for allocation to users, such as
in host configurations with the DHCP. An address-assignment pool can support either IPv4
address or IPv6 addresses. You cannot use the same pool for both types of address.
Q3. What is DHCP address assignment?
A. The assignment of IP addresses happens dynamically within a given address range. As a
result, a device connected to the network doesn't have a forever address. The IP address can
periodically change as its lease time expires unless the lease is successfully renewed.
Q4. What is DHCP address allocation?
A. DHCP assigns an IP address from a pool of addresses for a limited period of time chosen by
the server, or until the client tells the DHCP server that it no longer needs the address.
Q5. What is dhcp address reservation?
A. When you use DHCP IP reservation, you're telling your Wi-Fi network to assign the same IP
address to a specific device whenever that device connects to your network.
Q6. What is dhcp address lease time?
A. When DHCP sends configuration information to a client, the information is sent with a lease
time. This is the length of time that the client can use the IP address it has been assigned. The
duration of the lease time can be changed according to your specific requirement.

Q7. What is DHCP address renewal time?
A. Generally, the recommended time to lease an IP address is 48 hours to renew the IP address
once a day. After applying the specified parameters, clients will receive an IP address for 1
minute, after which they will send a request to the DHCP server for a new IP address every 30
seconds.
