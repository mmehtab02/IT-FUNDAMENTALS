21_SAS ON NETWORK TYPES

What is a LAN?
LOCAL AREA NETWORK - NETWORK WHERE DEVICES CAN COMMUNICATE TO EACH OTHER LOCALLY WITH VERY HIGH BANDWIDTHS/SPEED.


What are the typical network connections for a LAN?
TYPICALLY THEY ARE ETHERNET NETWORKS OR 802.11 WIRELESS NETWORKS.
ANYTHING SLOWER MEANS THAT IT ISN’T “LOCAL”.

 \What is a WAN?
IF YOUR DEVICES ARE COMMUNICATING TO A LOCATION IN ANOTHER CITY, COUNTRY, ETC. THEN IT IS OVER A WAN (WIDE AREA NETWORK).
THESE NETWORKS SPAN THE GLOBE.
Why are the speeds slower on a WAN compared to LAN?
THERE ARE LONG DISTANCES INVOLVED IN GETTING A SIGNAL FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER.
GENERALLY THESE CONNECT LANS ACROSS A DISTANCE.


What are some examples of technologies used in a WAN?
POINT TO POINT SERIAL CONNECTION
MPLS
ETC.


How are WANs connected?
SOMETIMES THESE WANS ARE CONNECTED WITH FIBER THAT’S IN THE GROUND, OR YOU MAY BE COMMUNICATING THROUGH A NON-TERRESTRIAL OR SATELLITE LINK.
(TERRESTRIAL, NON-TERRESTRIAL)


What is a PAN?
PERSONAL AREA NETWORK - NETWORK USED TO CONNECT DEVICES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.
THIS IS YOUR OWN PRIVATE NETWORK.


What are some examples of technologies used in a PAN?
IT COULD USE BLUETOOTH, INFRARED, OR NFC TECHNOLOGIES FOR EXAMPLE.

What is one of the most common ways to connect a personal area network?
CONNECTING A WIRELESS HEADSET TO YOUR PHONE.
CAN ALSO CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO AN AUTOMOBILE TO USE THE AUDIO SYSTEM, MAP, OR CONTACT LIST FOR EXAMPLE.

What type of telemetry can be acquired using a personal area network?
WORKOUT TELEMETRY.
IF YOU’RE WORKING OUT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO USE A PAN NETWORK TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE EQUIPMENT WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE REPORTS BASED ON THIS WORKOUT TELEMETRY YOU ACQUIRED USING THE PAN.

What is a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)?
THESE ARE NETWORKS WHERE YOU MAY USE TO CONNECT TO A COMPANY WITH MANY LOCATIONS WITHIN THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL AREA.

How does the distance of a MAN compare to that of a LAN and WAN?
A MAN DISTANCE IS LONGER THAN A WAN, BUT SHORTER THAN A WAN.
THIS MIDDLE RANGE WITH A MAN IS GENERALLY LOCATIONS WITHIN THE SAME CITY.

What is the most common topology for connecting sites in a MAN today?
METRO ETHERNET
WHEN ETHERNET CONNECTION IS GIVEN ON BOTH SIDES (LOCATIONS) AND THE ISP PROVIDES THE LINK BETWEEN THESE LOCATIONS.

What type of organizations tend to use Metropolitan Area Networks?
GOVERNMENTS SINCE THEY OWN RIGHT OF WAY TO USE THE GROUND TO EXTEND FIBER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEIR DIFFERENT NETWORK LOCATIONS.

What is a Storage Area Network (SAN)?
A HIGH SPEED NETWORK THAT ALLOWS TO COMMUNICATE TO A CENTRALIZED STORAGE FACILITY GENERALLY WITH A LARGE CAPACITY.

How is data accessed on a SAN?
THE DATA IS STORED IN A CENTRALIZED FORM OF STORAGE CALLED THE S.A.N.
SAN PROVIDES BLOCK LEVEL ACCESS SIMILAR TO BLOCK LEVEL ACCESS ON LOCAL STORAGE DEVICES SUCH AS A LAPTOP. IT MAKES IT EFFICIENT TO READ AND WRITE TO THAT SAN. IT MAKES IT LOOK AND FEEL LIKE A LOCAL STORAGE DEVICE.

What is the typical bandwidth requirement for a SAN?
EVEN WITH THE EFFICIENT READ/WRITE CAPABILITIES THERE STILL MAY BE LARGE DATA COMMUNICATION WHICH MEANS THERE ARE USUALLY VERY HIGH BANDWIDTHS REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO THESE SANS.

Are SANs isolated on their own networks?
YES, THEY MAY USE AN ISOLATED NETWORK AND HIGH-SPEED NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES.

What is a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)?
WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORK - NETWORK THAT ALLOWS WIRELESS COMMUNICATION USING AN 802.11 NETWORK.

What is the range of a WLAN?
THE RANGE IS SHORT THEREFORE YOU OFTEN SEE THEM INSIDE BUILDINGS OR LOCALIZED AREAS LIKE YOUR HOUSE.
THE MOBILITY IS LIMITED WITHIN FOR EXAMPLE A BUILDING OR A LIMITED GEOGRAPHICAL AREA.

How can the size of a WLAN be extended?
YOU CAN EXPAND COVERAGE USING WIRELESS ACCESS POINTS (WAP/AP).
EXAMPLES OF THIS ARE IN A DOWNTOWN AREA, OR A LARGE CAMPUS.

How do WLANs differ from other wireless networks?
THEY HAVE LIMITED COVERAGE AREA AND ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE A SPECIFIC AREA / LOCATION.
THEY REQUIRE AND RELY ON (WAP) ACCESS POINTS TO ALLOW DEVICE COMMUNICATION OVER THE WAN.
THEY ARE TYPICALLY PRIVATELY OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS, OR BUSINESSES AND CAN MANAGE CONFIGURATION, SECURITY, ACCESS PERMISSION SETTINGS.
GENERALLY THEY OFFER HIGHER SPEEDS AND BANDWIDTHS.
WLANS MAY USE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE NETWORK SUCH AS WPA2 OR WPA3.










Section -B  Q&A Network Types

Q1. What is a LAN?

A. LOCAL AREA NETWORK - NETWORK WHERE DEVICES CAN COMMUNICATE TO EACH OTHER LOCALLY WITH VERY HIGH BANDWIDTHS/SPEED.
TYPICALLY THEY ARE ETHERNET NETWORKS OR 802.11 WIRELESS NETWORKS.
ANYTHING SLOWER MEANS THAT IT ISN’T “LOCAL”.

Q2. What is a WAN network?

A. IF YOUR DEVICES ARE COMMUNICATING TO A LOCATION IN ANOTHER CITY, COUNTRY, ETC. THEN IT IS OVER A WAN (WIDE AREA NETWORK).
THESE NETWORKS SPAN THE GLOBE.
SPEEDS ARE SLOWER ON WAN COMPARED TO LAN BECAUSE THERE ARE LONG DISTANCES INVOLVED IN GETTING A SIGNAL FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER.
GENERALLY THESE CONNECT LANS ACROSS A DISTANCE.




POINT TO POINT SERIAL CONNECTION, MPLS, ETC. ARE EXAMPLES OF TECHNOLOGIES USED IN A WAN.


SOMETIMES THESE WANS ARE CONNECTED WITH FIBER THAT’S IN THE GROUND, OR YOU MAY BE COMMUNICATING THROUGH A NON-TERRESTRIAL OR SATELLITE LINK. (TERRESTRIAL, NON-TERRESTRIAL)

Q3. What is a PAN network?
A. PERSONAL AREA NETWORK - NETWORK USED TO CONNECT DEVICES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY. THIS IS YOUR OWN PRIVATE NETWORK.


IT COULD USE BLUETOOTH, INFRARED, OR NFC TECHNOLOGIES FOR EXAMPLE.

MOST COMMON WAYS TO CONNECT TO A PAN ARE : CONNECTING A WIRELESS HEADSET TO YOUR PHONE.
YOU CAN ALSO CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO AN AUTOMOBILE TO USE THE AUDIO SYSTEM, MAP, OR CONTACT LIST FOR EXAMPLE.

WORKOUT TELEMETRY.
IF YOU’RE WORKING OUT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO USE A PAN NETWORK TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE EQUIPMENT WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE REPORTS BASED ON THIS WORKOUT TELEMETRY YOU ACQUIRED USING THE PAN.


Q4. What is MAN network?
A. THESE ARE NETWORKS WHERE YOU MAY USE TO CONNECT TO A COMPANY WITH MANY LOCATIONS WITHIN THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL AREA.

A MAN DISTANCE IS LONGER THAN A WAN, BUT SHORTER THAN A WAN.
THIS MIDDLE RANGE WITH A MAN IS GENERALLY LOCATIONS WITHIN THE SAME CITY.

THE MOST COMMON TOPOLOGY FOR CONNECTING SITES IN A MAN IS METRO ETHERNET.
THIS IS WHEN ETHERNET CONNECTION IS GIVEN ON BOTH SIDES (LOCATIONS) AND THE ISP PROVIDES THE LINK BETWEEN THESE LOCATIONS.
