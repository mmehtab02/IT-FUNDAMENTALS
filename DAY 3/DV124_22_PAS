22_SAS ON NETWORK TOOLS

Q1. What is cable crimping?
A. WHEN YOU RUN NEW NETWORKING CABLES, IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY CONNECTORS ON THE END. YOU NEED A TOOL THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ADD THOSE CONNECTORS ONTO THE END OF THE CABLE. THIS TOOL IS CALLED A CABLE CRIMPER.

THEY LOOK SIMILAR TO PLIERS BUT THEY ARE DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO ADD CONNECTORS TO THE CABLE.

THESE WILL PINCH CONNECTORS ONTO THE WIRES.

THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRIMPERS.

YOU CAN ADD SPECIFIC CONNECTORS TO THE END OF SPECIFIC CABLES SUCH AS COAXIAL, TWISTER PAIR, FIBER FABLES.

THIS IS THE FINAL STEP. YOU WOULD RUN THE CABLES THROUGH THE FLOOR / CEILING AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CABLE ON BOTH SIDES THAT NEED A CONNECTOR ON BOTH ENDS.

THESE CONNECTORS ARE CONSIDERED MODULAR CONNECTORS.

FOR TWISTED PAIR CABLES SUCH AS ETHERNET CABLES THE CRIMPERS ARE PUSHING METAL PRONGS THROUGH THE INSULATION INTO THE COPPER IN THE WIRE ITSELF.

THE PLUG IS PERMANENTLY PRESSED ONTO THE CABLE SHEATH.

Q2. What is a modular connector?
THIS IS THE CONNECTOR THAT WE WOULD CRIMP WITH THE CABLE IN USE.

IN THE CASE OF RJ45 CONNECTORS, THERE ARE COPPER CONNECTIONS SITTING AT THE ENDS OF THE CONNECTOR.

WHEN YOU USE THE CRIMPER, IT PUSHES DOWN ALL THOSE INDIVIDUAL CONNECTIONS / WIRES INSIDE THE CABLE.

THERE ARE SHARP PRONGS THAT ARE PUSHED THROUGH THE INSULATION TO MAKE A CONNECTION WITH THE COPPER INSIDE EACH INDIVIDUAL STRAND.

THIS ALLOWS FOR THE COPPER INSIDE THE WIRES TO EXTEND CONNECTION INTO THESE COPPER MODULAR RJ45 CONNECTORS WHICH WILL THEN BE ABLE TO BE PLUGGED INTO / CONNECTED TO A DEVICE.

AFTER THE CRIMP, THE INDIVIDUAL STRAND CONNECTORS HAVE BEEN PUSHED DOWN INTO THE RJ45 CONNECTOR.

THE SPIKY ENDS OF THE COPPER CONNECTOR HAVE NOW MADE A CONNECTION INTO THE WIRE STRANDS INSIDE THE RJ45 CONNECTOR.

THE COPPER CONNECTIONS ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE RJ45 CONNECTOR ARE ON THE OUTSIDE ALLOWING IT TO PLUG IN AND EXCHANGE SIGNAL WITH ANY DEVICE YOU CONNECT WITH.

THERE IS ALSO A CABLE STAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CONNECTOR THAT PUSHES INTO THE SHEATH OF THE CABLE TO HOLD IT IN PLACE.

YOU WOULD NEED A CRIMPER TO MAKE THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CABLE AND THE RJ45 CONNECTOR. YOU MAY ALSO NEED A PAIR OF ELECTRICIAN SCISSORS / CABLE SNIPS, AND A WIRE STRIPPER TO REMOVE THE SHEATH FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE ETHERNET WIRES.

THERE ARE DIFFERENT WIRE TYPES LIKE CAT5, CAT6, CAT7, AND THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT MODULAR CONNECTORS FOR THESE CABLE TYPES.

Q3. What is a wifi analyzer?
A. IF YOU ARE USING A WIRELESS NETWORK, INSTEAD OF SPENDING TIME MAKING PHYSICAL CRIMPS ON CABLES, YOU WOULD SPEND TIME UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES IN USE ON THAT WIRELESS NETWORK.

A WI-FI ANALYZER HELPS UNDERSTAND THIS. THESE ANALYZERS WILL LISTEN TO ALL SIGNALS ON THE NETWORK AND PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT FREQUENCIES ARE IN USE AND WHICH ONES MAY BE OPEN.

THESE ARE EASY TO USE. IT MAY BE ADD-ON SOFTWARE THAT YOU ADD TO A LAPTOP OR MOBILE DEVICE, OR IT MAY BE A PURPOSE-BUILT PIECE OF HARDWARE THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ANALYZE WIFI NETWORKS.

IT SPECIALIZES IN 801.11 ANALYSES.

THESE WIFI ANALYZERS CAN BE VERY USEFUL IF YOU ARE IN AN AREA WITH A LOT OF WIFI ACCESS POINTS (WAPS) AS IT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE EXACTLY WHERE INTERFERENCE MAY BE OCCURRING ON THIS NETWORK.

IT GIVES YOU VISUALS TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE NETWORK ALLOWING YOU TO MAKE CHANGES WHEN NECESSARY EASILY. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU NEED TO ADJUST A WIFI ANTENNA AND WHERE IT IS POINTING, YOU CAN MAKE THE CHANGE AND VISUALLY SEE WHAT THE EFFECTS OF THIS CHANGE ARE.

IT ALLOWS TO IDENTIFY ERRORS AND INTERFERENCE.

Q4. What is a tone generator and probe?
A. IT IS A 2-PIECE NETWORKING TOOL THAT ALLOWS YOU TO IDENTIFY A CABLE.

A TONE GENERATOR IS THE PIECE THAT PUTS AN ANALOG SIGNAL ON A COPPER WIRE.

THE OTHER PIECE IS AN INDUCTIVE PROBE WHICH ONLY NEEDS TO GET CLOSE TO THE CABLE (DOESN’T NEED TO PHYSICALLY TOUCH) JUST TO HEAR THE TONE THAT IS GENERATED ON THE OTHER END OF THE CABLE THROUGH A SMALL SPEAKER.

THIS ALLOWS YOU TO EASILY FIND WHERE A CABLE MIGHT BE ESPECIALLY IN COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS WHERE YOU MAY HAVE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF CABLES RUNNING ACROSS THE DATA CENTER / LOCATION.

IT ALLOWS FOR EASY WIRE TRACING.

FIRST YOU CONNECT THE TONE GENERATOR TO ONE END OF THE WIRE WITH EITHER THE MODULAR JACK ON THE TONE GENERATOR OR THERE COULD BE ALLIGATOR CLIPS OR SOME CONNECTION TYPE TO CONNECT TO THAT CABLE. IT COULD BE ANY CABLE TYPE IN USE SUCH AS COAX, MODULAR JACK, PUNCH DOWN CONNECTORS.

THEN YOU WOULD GO TO THE OTHER END WHERE THE CABLE WOULD BE WHICH WHICH TYPICALLY IS BUNCHED WITH A LOT OF CABLES, THEN YOU USE THE INDUCTIVE PROBE TO MOVE FROM CABLE TO CABLE TO IDENTIFY WHICH EXACT CABLE CONTAINS THAT PARTICULAR TONE.

Q5. What is a punch down tool?
A. YOU WON’T BE USING RJ45 CONNECTORS IN SOME ENVIRONMENTS, INSTEAD YOU ARE CONNECTING TO A PUNCH DOWN BLOCK.

YOU MUST “PUNCH” EVERY WIRE INDIVIDUALLY INTO A WIRING BLOCK, WHICH CAN BE TEDIOUS IF YOU ARE WORKING WITH A LOT OF CABLES AS YOU MUST TAKE EACH CABLE AND EACH WIRE INSIDE THE CABLE AND PUNCH THEM INDIVIDUALLY INTO THEIR OWN SLOT ON THE PUNCH DOWN BLOCK.

THE TOOL YOU WOULD USE IS A PUNCH DOWN TOOL.
IT PUSHES THE WIRE INTO THE PUNCH DOWN BLOCK AS WELL AS CUTS OFF / TRIMS THE EXCESS WIRE MAKING A NEAT CONNECTION TO THE BLOCK.

THERE WILL BE MANY CABLES WITH MANY WIRES, THEREFORE ORGANIZATION IS IMPORTANT. YOU WOULD HAVE NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH PUNCH DOWN BLOCK TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT CABLE IS ON WHAT CONNECTION.

THE TWIST OF ETHERNET CABLES SHOULD BE MAINTAINED.

IT’S IMPORTANT TO DOCUMENT EVERYTHING AS EACH NUMBER OF THE PUNCH DOWN CONNECTOR CAN BE DUPLICATED ON THE OTHER END OF THE CABLE.

Q6. What are cable testers?
A. A NETWORKING TOOL THAT USUALLY COMES IN TWO UNITS WHICH YOU PLUG A CABLE INTO EACH END.

THERE IS A BUILT IN CONTINUITY TEST TO CHECK IF THE PINS ARE CONNECTED.

SOME OF THEM CAN TELL YOU IF YOU MISSED OF IMPROPERLY PUNCHED DOWN CERTAIN WIRES, OR CROSSED WIRED INTO DIFFERENT PINS.

THESE CABLE TESTERS ARE SIMPLE AND DON’T HAVE A LOT OF ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THINGS SUCH AS CROSSTALK VALUES BETWEEN WIRES OR HOW MUCH SIGNAL LOSS OCCURS FROM ONE END OF THE CABLE TO THE OTHER, YOU CAN USE MORE ADVANCED TOOLS LIKE TDR (TIME DOMAIN REFLECTOMETER). THESE CABLE TESTERS ARE NOT USUALLY USED FOR FREQUENCY TESTING.

THIS TOOL IS A SIMPLE WAY OF TESTING TO SEE IF CABLES ARE ABLE TO FUNCTION AND COMMUNICATE DATA PROPERLY.

IT IS A SIMPLE WIRE MAP.

Q7. What is a loopback plug?
A. ANOTHER NETWORK TOOL THAT IS USEFUL FOR TESTING PHYSICAL PORTS SUCH AS THE INTERFACE ON YOUR DEVICE.

THERE ARE CONNECTORS WITH DATA COMING OUT OF AN THAT LOOP BACK AROUND RIGHT BACK INTO THE SAME CONNECTOR / DEVICE.

YOU CAN SEND INFORMATION OUT SOMETHING LIKE A SERIAL PORT (SERIAL / RS232 {9/25 PIN}), RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION BACK, THEN COMPARE THOSE VALUES TO SEE IF THEY MATCH.

(RJ-45 ETHERNET, SERIAL, LOOPBACK PLUGS)

IF THEY DON’T MATCH THEN THERE’S A CHANCE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE.

THERE ARE LOOPBACK CABLES YOU CAN GET FOR OTHER TYPE OF CONNECTIONS SUCH AS ETHERNET, T1 WAN, OR FIBER.

THESE ARE NOT CROSSOVER CABLES (MULTIPLE DEVICES ARE NOT CONNECTING TOGETHER) BUT THESE ARE CABLES / CONNECTORS THAT SEND DATA OUT AND RIGHT BACK INTO THE SAME DEVICE / INTERFACE.

CROSSOVER CABLES COMMONLY CONNECT 2 DEVICES TO EACH OTHER BUT A LOOPBACK PLUG IS CONNECTING A DEVICE TO ITSELF.
