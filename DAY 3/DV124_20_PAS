20_SAS ON Internet Connection Types

What is satellite networking?
USING A SATELLITE DISH TO COMMUNICATE TO A SATELLITE THAT’S IN A LOW EARTH ORBIT. ALSO CALLED NON-TERRESTRIAL COMMUNICATION SINCE THE DEVICE IS IN SPACE.
How does the cost of satellite connectivity compare to other forms of internet connectivity?
IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN TERRESTRIAL NETWORKING.
What are typical speeds for satellite internet?
50 MEGABITS SPEED DOWN AND 3 MEGABITS SPEED GOING UP TO THE SATELLITE.
What are some common uses for satellite internet?
IT WOULD BE USED WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER TYPE OF INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AVAILABLE.
What is latency when communicating with satellites in space?
SINCE IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO GET PACKETS SENT TO AND BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND STATION, YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH LATENCY THAT MIGHT BE 250 MILLISECONDS GOING UP AND ANOTHER 250 MILLISECONDS GOING DOWN.
SOME NEWER SATELLITE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS STARLINK ADVERTISE 40 MILLISECOND LATENCY AND THEY ARE WORKING ON GETTING IT DOWN TO 20 MILLISECONDS.
How does satellite internet compare to terrestrial internet when it comes to latency?
SINCE IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO GET PACKETS SENT TO AND BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND STATION, YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH LATENCY THAT MIGHT BE 250 MILLISECONDS GOING UP AND ANOTHER 250 MILLISECONDS GOING DOWN.
IT IS HIGHER LATENCY COMPARED TO TERRESTRIAL INTERNET.
What is a newer type of satellite network?
STARLINK
What is the latency time advertised by Starlink?
40 MILLISECONDS WORKING ON 20 MILLISECONDS.
What frequency range do satellite connections operate in?
2 GIGAHERTZ
What is the cause of rain fade when using a satellite connection?
THESE SATELLITES OPERATE OVER LINE OF SIGHT MEANING THE RAIN FADE WILL CAUSE CONNECTION LOSS BETWEEN YOU AND THE SATELLITE.
What is the advantage of fiber optic links for internet connections?
IT IS HIGH SPEED. IT USES FREQUENCIES OF LIGHT.
THEY ARE GREAT FOR INTERNET CONNECTIONS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEND A LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO COMMUNICATE OVER LONG DISTANCES.
Why is fiber optics more expensive than other internet connections?
THE EQUIPMENT COSTS A BIT MORE. THE REPAIRS WOULD BE EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT.
How is fiber optics used in enterprise networks?
THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVICES AND THE CORES OF THE NETWORK ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER USING FIBER OPTIC.
THESE ARE USED AS LARGE INSTALLATIONS IN THE WIDE AREA NETWORK CORES.
IT SUPPORTS HIGH DATA RATES.
How does running fiber optics to a home or business improve bandwidth?
THE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS FOR HIGH BANDWIDTH ON YOUR INTERNET CONNECTIONS AND GIVES YOU OTHER OPTIONS FOR SENDING / RECEIVING INFORMATION OVER THESE HIGH SPEED LINKS.
IT IS SLOWLY APPROACHING THE HOME/BUSINESS PREMISE OUTSIDE OF ENTERPRISE PREMISES.


What is the method of communication used by cable broadband?
THE SAME CABLE YOU USE FOR CABLE TV CAN BE USED FOR INTERNET BY THE CABLE COMPANY.
BROADBAND DESCRIBES A METHOD OF COMMUNICATION WHERE YOU CAN SEND MULTIPLE STREAMS OF DATA ACROSS A SINGLE WIRE BY COMMUNICATING ACROSS MULTIPLE FREQUENCIES ON THAT WIRE.
YOU CAN SEND DIFFERENT TRAFFIC TYPES ON ONE WIRE.
How does cable broadband transmit video, voice, and data?
A SINGLE WIRE CAN TRANSMIT THESE DATA TYPES SIMPLY BY USING DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES ON THAT SAME MEDIUM.
Who might provide cable broadband service?
A CABLE COMPANY THAT PROVIDES CABLE TV.
What is the standard for sending data over cable networks?
DOCSIS (DATA OVER CABLE SERVICE INTERFACE SPECIFICATION)
What are the typical speeds of DOCSIS networks?
THEY CAN BE TYPICAL SPEEDS OR EVEN HIGH SPEEDS, SUCH AS 1 GIGABIT OR EVEN HIGHER.
TYPICALLY 50 MEGABITS/SECOND - 1000+ MEGABITS/SECOND.
Do you need to bring additional cables or services into your home for DOCSIS?
NO, SAME CABLE CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE SERVICES.
What is the technology that uses existing copper in a home?
DSL (DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE) OR ADSL (ASYMMETRIC) WHICH USES EXISTING TELEPHONE LINES FOR HIGH SPEED NETWORK CONNECTIONS.
What is the difference between the speed of download and upload on DSL?
IN THE CASE OF ADSL, THE SPEED OF DOWNLOAD IS OFTEN FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF UPLOAD.
What are the typical speeds of DSL networks?
200 MEGABITS PER SECOND DOWN, 20 MEGABITS PER SECOND UP
What is the limitation of DSL in terms of distance?
THE SPEEDS ARE LIMITED BY HOW FAR AWAY YOU ARE FROM THE CENTRAL OFFICE. THE FARTHER IT IS, THE SLOWER THE SPEEDS.


THERE IS A 10,000 FOOT LIMITATION IN DSL, SO YOU HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO YOUR CENTRAL OFFICE TO HAVE DSL CAPABILITIES.

What type of networks are commonly used for internet connectivity when away from home or office?
CELLULAR NETWORKS - MOBILE NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH A CELL PHONE.
How is internet connectivity provided through cellular networks?
INSTEAD OF SENDING VOICE OVER THE NETWORK, YOU ARE COMMUNICATING SENDING DATA.

SEPARATES LAND INTO ‘CELLS’ - ANTENNA COVERAGES A CELL WITH CERTAIN FREQUENCIES.

THERE IS TETHERING, HOTSPOT, AND WISP.
What is tethering?
PHYSICALLY CONNECT TO OUR PHONE VIA USB OR THROUGH BLUETOOTH AND USE OUR PHONE AS AN INTERNET CONNECTION.

THIS TURNS YOUR PHONE INTO A WIRELESS ROUTER.


What is a hotspot?
PHONE ENABLES 802.11 CAPABILITIES AND ANYTHING IN RANGE WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THAT 802.11 NETWORK THROUGH YOUR PHONE TO ACCESS THE INTERNET.


What is a WISP?
AN ISP SENDS INFORMATION OVER A WIRELESS NETWORK TO YOUR HOME (WIRELESS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER).

	THIS IS TERRESTRIAL WIRELESS INTERNET ACCESS.

UNLIKE SATELLITE, WERE SENDING INFORMATION TO LOCAL GROUND STATIONS IN OUR GEOGRAPHIC AREA FOR THAT ISP, NOT SPACE.


In what areas are WISPs commonly found?

RURAL AREAS OR PLACES WHERE THERE’S NOT A LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO SEND INTERNET TRAFFIC (REMOTE LOCATIONS).

THERE ARE DIFFERENT DEPLOYMENT TECHNOLOGIES LIKE :
MESHED 802.11
5G HOME INTERNET
PROPRIETARY WIRELESS

MOST LIKELY AN OUTDOOR ANTENNA IS REQUIRED.

What are the typical speeds of wireless networks provided by WISPs?
THESE NETWORKS CAN OPERATE UP TO 1000 MEGABITS PER SECOND.
