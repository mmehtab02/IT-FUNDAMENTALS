What is DNS and how does it work?


DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM - SERVICE THAT CONVERTS HUMAN READABLE DOMAIN NAMES THAT WE TYPE IN BROWSER TO COMPUTER-READABLE IP ADDRESSES FOR NETWORK COMMUNICATION.


ENTER DOMAIN NAME ON BROWSER -> SEND DNS QUERY TO DNS RESOLVER
DNS RESOLVER CHECKS CACHE FOR PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED IP ADDRESS OF GIVEN DOMAIN NAME. IF FOUND, IT RETURNS IP ADDRESS TO REQUESTING DEVICE (RECURSIVE RESOLUTION)
IF IT DOESN’T FIND IN CACHE, IT BEINGS ITERATIVE RESOLUTION PROCESS BY CONTACTING ROOT DNS SERVERS (TOP-LEVEL SERVERS RESPONSIBLE FOR ROOT ZONE OF DNS HIERARCHY).
TLD RESOLUTION - RESOLVER CONTACTS APPROPRIATE TLD (TOP-LEVEL DOMAIN) SERVER (.COM FOR EXAMPLE) TO GET INFO ABOUT AUTHORITATIVE NAME SERVERS RESPONSIBLE FOR NEXT LEVEL OF DOMAIN.
AUTHORITATIVE DOMAIN - RESOLVER CONTACTS ANS IDENTIFIED BY TLDS. THESE SERVERS HAVE THE DNS RECORDS FOR THE DOMAIN, LIKE THE IP ADDRESS.
RESPONSE AND CACHING - ANS PROVIDES IP ADDRESS TO RESOLVER WHICH PROVIDES TO REQUESTING DEVICE. RESOLVER ALSO CACHES THE IP ADDRESS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.
IP ADDRESS IS OBTAINED FROM RESOLVER, THEREFORE YOUR CLIENT CAN ESTABLISH A CONNECTION WITH THE SERVER HOSTING THE WEBSITE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOMAIN NAME. YOUR BROWSER GETS THIS WEB PAGE INFO AND NOW YOU CAN ACCESS THE WEBSITE.




What is the structure of the DNS hierarchy?
THE DNS ORGANIZED DOMAIN NAMES INTO LEVELS / TIERS IN A HIERARCHICAL TREE-LIKE STRUCTURE WITH MULTIPLE LEVELS REPRESENTING DIFFERENT COMPONENTS.
ROOT LEVEL (ENTRY POINT) (“.”)
TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS (TLDS) - HIGHEST LEVEL IN DNS HIERARCHY DIVIDED INTO 2 TYPES :
GENERIC TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS - GENERAL PURPOSE DOMAIN EXTENSIONS LIKE .COM, .NET, .ORG, .GOV.
COUNTRY CODE TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS - COUNTRY SPECIFIC DOMAIN EXTENSIONS SUCH AS .US, .UK, .CA, .JP.
3) SECOND-LEVEL DOMAINS - SLDS ARE THE NEXT LEVEL AND ARE SPECIFIC TO ORGANIZATIONS OR ENTITIES THAT OWN THE DOMAIN NAMES. EXAMPLES : IN “WWW.EXAMPLE.COM” “EXAMPLE” IS THE SLD.
4) SUBDOMAINS - ADDITIONAL LEVELS IN DNS HIERARCHY. THIS ALLOWS MORE CATEGORIZATION AND ORGANIZATION OF DOMAIN NAMES UNDER SLD. THESE ARE SEPERATED BY PERIODS (“.”) AND LEFT OF THE SLD. EXAMPLE : “WWW.EXAMPLE.COM” “WWW” IS THE SUBDOMAIN OF “EXAMPLE.COM”.
5) HOSTNAMES REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL DEVICES OR SERVICES WITHIN A DOMAIN. THEY ARE ON THE LEFT OF THE SUBDOMAIN AND CAN BE FURTHER ORGANIZED INTO SUBDOMAINS. EXAMPLE : “WWW.SUBDOMAIN.EXAMPLE.COM” “WWW” IS THE HOSTNAME.


ROOT LEVEL → TLDS → SLDS → SUBDOMAINS → HOSTNAMES → MORE


How can you see the translation of a domain name to an IP address?


How many root server clusters are there in DNS?
13 ROOT SERVER CLUSTERS DISTRIBUTED GLOBALLY.


What are generic top-level domains?
AFTER THE ROOT LEVEL, THE TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS (TLDS) ARE THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE DNS HIERARCHY.


GENERIC TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS - GENERAL PURPOSE DOMAIN EXTENSIONS LIKE .COM, .NET, .ORG, .GOV.




What is SPF


How many servers are in a root server cluster?
MULTIPLE SERVERS, WITH ALL 13 ROOT SERVER CLUSTERS CONSISTING OF OVER 1000 SERVERS.


What is the purpose of having three different IP addresses associated with a web server?
REDUNDANCY - IF ONE OF THEM IS NOT AVAILABLE, YOUR DEVICE CAN USE ANY OF THE ADDRESSES TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE WEBSITE.


How can you check the IP addresses associated with a website if the dig command is not available?
IF
DIG WWW.EXAMPLE.COM
IS NOT AVAILABLE
YOU CAN USE
NS LOOKUP EXAMPLE.COM


What are resource records in DNS?
TO PERFORM THE PROCESSES OF FINDING AN IP ADDRESS FOR A DOMAIN NAME, THERE ARE DATABASE RECORDS OF THIS INFORMATION (IP, DOMAIN, ETC.) THAT ARE USED FOR THIS PROCESS.
THIS DATABASE OF RECORDS IS REFERRED TO AS RESOURCE RECORDS. THERE ARE OVER 30 DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESOURCE RECORDS (RR) SUCH AS IP ADDRESSES, CERTIFICATES, HOST NAMES, ETC.




Why is a DNS server considered a critical resource?
IF A DNS SERVER WASN’T AVAILABLE, THERE WOULD BE NO WAY TO MAKE A REQUEST TO VISIT WWW.EXAMPLE.COM. DNS SERVERS ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE TRANSLATION OF THIS FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME TO AN IP ADDRESS TO BRING IT UP ON YOUR FRONT END CLIENT.
DNS SERVERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NAME RESOLUTION WHICH ALLOWS US TO ACCESS WEBSITES, SEND EMAILS, AND PERFORM OTHER INTERNET ACTIVITIES.
THEY ENABLE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND ACCESSIBILITY.
THERE IS INFRASTRUCTURE DEPENDENCY ON DNS FOR OPERATING, SUCH AS WEB BROWSING, EMAIL, VOIP, REMOTE ACCESS, GAMING, ETC.
THESE DNS SERVERS ARE DESIGNED WITH REDUNDANCY AND RESILIENCE IN MINE WITH THE DNS SYSTEM DISTRIBUTED GLOBALLY ACROSS MULTIPLE SERVERS.
THEY ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN SECURITY AND CONTROL MECHANISMS.
How is a DNS server's configuration typically stored?
IN A CONFIGURATION FILE THAT IS TEXT BASED. YOU CAN USE A TEXT EDITOR TO MODIFY OR UPDATE THIS FILE TO CHANGE CONFIGURATION.
A DNS SERVER’S CONFIGURATION MAY ALSO HAVE THE CONFIGURATIONS STORED IN A WEB-BASED FRONT END WHERE YOU CAN MAKE CHANGES FROM.
ZONE FILES ARE THE TEXT-BASED FILES OF DNS CONFIGURATION.
THERE ARE ALSO METHODS THAT A DNS SERVER SOFTWARE USES FOR CONFIGURATION FILES SUCH AS DATABASE BACKENDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE INTERFACES (LIKE THE WEB-BASED FRONT END OR A COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE).
What is an A record and a AAAA record in DNS?
THESE ARE KNOWN AS ADDRESS RECORDS AND THE MOST COMMON / POPULAR FOR QUERY. THESE DEFINE THE IP ADDRESS OF THE HOST. THE RECORD IN QUESTION WILL HAVE A DOMAIN NAME AND THE ASSOCIATED IP ADDRESS.
A RECORDS MAP A DOMAIN NAME TO AN IPV4 ADDRESS. THEY ARE USED TO RESOLVE A DOMAIN NAME TO THE CORRESPONDING IP ADDRESS.
AAAA (QUAD-A) RECORDS MAP A DOMAIN NAME TO AN IPV6 ADDRESS. THEY RESOLVE DOMAIN NAMES TO IPV6 ADDRESSES.
Is it possible to configure DNS using a web-based front end?
YES
How is the time to live in DNS server specified?
IT SPECIFIES HOW LONG AN END STATION WILL REMEMBER THIS MATCH BETWEEN A FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME AND IP ADDRESS.
FOR EXAMPLE IF THE TIME TO LIVE IS 15 MINUTES, THE DEVICE THAT MAKES THE REQUEST TO A DNS SERVER AND STORES / CACHES THAT INFORMATION FOR 15 MINUTES. AFTER 15 MINUTES, THAT INFORMATION IS REMOVED FROM THE CACHE AND THE DEVICE WOULD NEED TO REQUEST FOR THE IP ADDRESS OF THAT RECORD AGAIN IF IT NEEDS TO COMMUNICATE BACK TO THE WWW SERVER.
YOU CONFIGURE THE DNS ZONE TIME, THE DNS SERVER RECEIVES A QUERY AND SENDS THE TTL VALUE TO THE CLIENT / DNS RESOLVER, THE DNS INFORMATION IS CACHES FOR THE SPECIFIED TIME AND THIS CACHE CAN SERVE DOMAIN INFORMATION WITHOUT QUERYING THE DNS SERVER, AND AFTER THE TTL EXPIRES THE CLIENT / RESOLVER DISCARDS THE CACHED INFO. THE DNS SERVER WOULD NEED TO BE QUERIED AGAIN TO GET THE INFORMATION.
What does it mean if a device requests the IP address for a particular record?
IT IS IN REFERENCE TO A CLIENT / DNS RESOLVER QUERYING A DNS SERVER OR RECEIVING THIS DNS INFORMATION FROM THE CACHE.
THE RECORD ASSOCIATED WITH A DOMAIN NAME MAPS IT TO AN IP ADDRESS, AND THESE RECORDS ARE IN THE DNS SERVERS.
IF A DEVICE REQUESTS AN IP ADDRESS FOR A PARTICULAR RECORD, IT IS INITIATING THE DNS RESOLUTION PROCESS TO OBTAIN THE COMPUTER-READ IP ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HUMAN-READ DOMAIN NAME.
How is the same information presented in a web-based front end compared to a text file?
IT INCLUDES THE DOMAIN NAME, THE TYPE OF RECORD, THE IP ADDRESS, WITH THE OPTION OF ADDING REMARKS OR COMMENTS IN A TEXT FILE.
THE WEB-BASED CONFIGURATION HAS THE SAME INFORMATION BUT MAY SEPARATE CERTAIN VALUES SUCH AS THE TYPE, THE HOSTNAME, THE IP ADDRESS, AND TTL VALUES, AND PERHAPS MORE.
THE WEB-BASED FRONT END IS MORE USER-FRIENDLY FOR ADMINS TO INTERACT WITH SETTINGS, WHILE THE TEXT-BASED FORMAT ALLOWS FOR MANUAL EDITING TO ACCESS PRECISE CONTROL OVER DNS CONFIGURATION DETAILS.
THERE MAY BE EXTRA ABILITIES IN A WEB BASED FRONT END OVER TEXT BASED AND VICE VERSA. IT COMES DOWN TO THE REQUIREMENT AND EASE OF USE FOR THE ADMINS.
What is the purpose of the time to live in a DNS server?
IT SPECIFIES HOW LONG AN END STATION WILL REMEMBER THIS MATCH BETWEEN A FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME AND IP ADDRESS IN ITS CACHE SO THAT DNS ADMINS CAN BALANCE THE NEED FOR EFFICIENT CACHING AND UPDATES OF DNS INFORMATION.
SHORT TTL VALUES ALLOW FOR QUICKER UPDATES BUT INCREASE THE DNS QUERY LOAD, WHILE LONG TTL VALUES ENHANCE THE CACHING EFFICIENCY BUT MAY DELAY PROPAGATION OF CHANGES MADE TO DNS RECORDS.
THESE ARE STORED IN THE RESOURCE RECORDS.
THE PURPOSE OF TTL IS CACHING EFFICIENCY TO REDUCE LOAD, CONTROLLING SPEED / PROPAGATION OF DNS UPDATES TO MANAGE DNS SERVER LOAD AND NETWORK TRAFFIC, LOAD DISTRIBUTION WITH DIFFERENT TTL VALUES ACROSS MULTIPLE DNS SERVERS TO HELP DISTRIBUTE LOAD AND IMPROVE PERFORMANCE / RESILIENCE OF DNS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND REDUCING DEPENDENCY ON UNAVAILABLE DNS SERVERS BY ALLOWING CLIENTS REFER TO CACHED DNS INFO WHICH ENSURES CONTINUITY OF DNS SERVICES IN CASE OF SERVER OUTAGES OR CONNECTION ISSUES.
How long is the time to live for a DNS server typically set for?
THE DEFAULT TTL AS PER THE VIDEO DNS RECORD INTERFACE IS 15 MINUTES.
THERE IS NO FIXED STANDARD FOR TTL VALUES. IT IS UP TO ADMINISTRATORS TO TAILOR THE VALUE BASED ON THEIR REQUIREMENTS.
COMMON VALUES RANGE FROM A FEW MINUTES (300 SECONDS) TO A FEW HOURS (3600 SECONDS) TO LONGER (86400 SECONDS / 24 HOURS).
What happens when the time to live for a DNS server is up?
AFTER THE TTL EXPIRES THE CLIENT / RESOLVER DISCARDS THE CACHED INFO. THE DNS SERVER WOULD NEED TO BE QUERIED AGAIN TO GET THE INFORMATION.
THE DNS RESOLUTION PROCESS NEED TO BE INITIATED AGAIN FOR THE CLIENT TO ACCESS THE DOMAIN NAME’S IP ADDRESS.
THE DNS INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE ASSOCIATED RESOURCE RECORD (RR) HAS REACHED THE END OF ITS VALIDITY PERIOD. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THESE ACTIONS TYPICALLY OCCUR :
CACHE EXPIRATION
DNS QUERY (IF REQUESTED AGAIN)
DNS RECORD UPDATE (IF UPDATES WERE MADE SINCE PREVIOUS TTL EXPIRATION)
DNS PROPAGATION - IF DNS INFO IS UPDATED, OTHER DNS RESOLVERS AND CLIENTS UPGRADE THEIR CACHE WITH FRESH DATA.
What is an MX (Mail Exhange) record in DNS?
TYPE OF RESOURCE RECORD (RR) THAT SPECIFIES THE MAIL SERVER RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCEPTING INCOMING EMAILS FOR A PARTICULAR DOMAIN.
THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR EMAIL DELIVERY AS THEY PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR ROUTING EMAILS TO THE CORRECT MAIL SERVER.
IT IS THE RECORD WHERE ALL YOUR EMAILS SHOULD BE DELIVERED.
IT CONTAINS SEVERAL VALUES SUCH AS THE DOMAIN (EXAMPLE.COM), ‘IN’ INTERNET CLASS, RR TYPE (MX), PRIORITY VALUE (10 FOR EX) IF MULTIPLE RECORDS, AND THE FQDM OF THE MAIL SERVER (MAILSERVER.EXAMPLE.COM).
What other record is needed in order for an MX record to work?
“A” RECORD FOR THE IPV4 IP ADDRESS, OR “AAAA” FOR THE IPV6 IP ADDRESS. THIS SPECIFIES THE IP ADDRESS OF THE MAIL SERVER MENTIONED IN THE MX RECORD.
THE MX RECORD POINTS TO THE MAIL SERVER BY ITS DOMAIN NAME (EXAMPLE.COM DOMAIN / HOSTNAME → MAILSERVER.EXAMPLE.COM MAIL SERVER)
THE A OR AAAA RECORD POINTS TO THE IP ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT DOMAIN NAME (MAILSERVER.EXAMPLE.COM HOSTNAME → 192.0.1.2 IPV4 ADDRESS).
What is the purpose of a TXT (Text) record in DNS?
TO STORE TEXT DATA ASSOCIATED WITH A DOMAIN. THESE ARE FLEXIBLE TO CONTAIN ANY TYPE OF HUMAN READABLE TEXT INFORMATION.
THEY CAN INCLUDE :
DOMAIN VERIFICATION - PROVIDERS MAY REQUIRE TO ADD SPECIFIC TXT RECORD TO THE DOMAIN’S DNS CONFIGURATION TO VERIFY / PROVE YOUR OWNERSHIP OF THE DOMAIN.
(SPF) SENDER POLICY FRAMEWORK - EMAIL AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM THAT SPECIFIES WHICH IP ADDRESSES / SERVERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO SEND EMAILS ON BEHALF OF THE DOMAIN VERIFIABLE BY RECEIVING EMAIL SERVERS.
(DKIM) DOMAINKEYS IDENTIFIED MAIL - ANOTHER EMAIL AUTHENTICATION THAT USES CRYPTOGRAPHIC SIGNATURES. RECEIVING EMAIL SERVERS CAN USE PUBLIC KEY USED FOR DKIM VERIFICATION STORED IN TXT RECORD TO VALIDATE SIGNATURES.
(DMARC) DOMAIN-BASED MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION, REPORTING, AND CONFORMANCE - EMAIL VALIDATION PROTOCOL THAT COMBINES SPF AND DKIM FOR GREATER CONTROL AND VISIBILITY OVER EMAIL AUTHENTICATION AND DELIVERY. DOMAIN OWNERS CAN DEFINE DMARC POLICIES FOR HANDLING FAILED EMAIL AUTHENTICATION.
SERVICE DISCOVERY - DESCRIPTIVE INFO FOR SERVICES / RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOMAIN (DESCRIPTIONS, VERSION NUMBERS, CONTACT INFO, CONFIG PARAMETERS).
HUMAN-READABLE INFORMATION - ANY OTHER TEXT INFO LIKE NOTES, COPYRIGHT INFO, ORGANIZATION DETAILS, ETC.
THESE TXT RECORDS CAN BE CREATED, MODIFIED, AND MANAGED BY DOMAIN ADMINISTRATORS THROUGH THE DNS PROVIDER / MANAGEMENT INTERFACE.
THESE TXT RECORDS ARE USUALLY PUBLIC INFO THAT CAN BE QUERIED.
ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR INFORMAL PURPOSES / INFO, BUT TODAY WE HAVE SPECIFIC USES FOR TXT RECORDS AS LISTED ABOVE.
CAN BE USED FOR VERIFICATION PURPOSES SUCH AS IF WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE DNS CONFIGURATION.
CAN BE USED FOR EMAIL SECURITY TO VERIFY ORIGINATION OF AN EMAIL.
How can the authenticity of an email be verified using a DNS text record?
EMAIL AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS SUCH AS SPF AND DKIM.
DMARC POLICIES THAT PROVIDE FRAMEWORK FOR HANDLING FAILED SPF AND DKIM CHECKS. THESE OFTEN WORK IN CONJUNCTION.
THE DNS TXT RECORDS WOULD CONTAIN EITHER A LIST OF SERVERS / IP ADDRESSES AUTHORIZED TO SEND EMAILS ON BEHALF OF A DOMAIN (SPF),
OR IT WOULD CONTAIN A PUBLIC KEY USED FOR THE DKIM VERIFICATION, VERIFYING THE DKIM SIGNATURE OF THE EMAIL THAT THE SENDING MAIL SERVER SIGNS WITH A PRIVATE KEY.
How can you view the text records for a specific domain?
YOU CAN USE
DIG EXAMPLE.COM TXT
TO LIST ALL TXT RECORDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DOMAIN.
YOU CAN ALSO USE
NSLOOKUP -TYPE=TXT EXAMPLE.COM
EXAMPLE.COM WOULD BE THE SPECIFIC DOMAIN THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO OBTAIN TEXT RECORDS FOR.
What are some examples of uses for text records in a DNS server?
LIKE MENTIONED EARLIER, WE CAN USE TEXT RECORDS FOR VERIFICATION, EMAIL SECURITY, SERVICE INFORMATION, AND ANY HUMAN-READABLE TEXT PURPOSES.
SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE LIKE FOR SIR PROFESSOR MESSERS DOMAIN, HE HAS 2 TEXT RECORDS CONFIGURED. ONE IS FOR STRIPE VERIFICATION, THE OTHER IS FOR SENDING OUT EMAIL MESSAGES.
FOR A WEBSITE LIKE GOOGLE THEY HAVE SEVERAL TEXT RECORDS FOR THINGS LIKE FACEBOOK DOMAIN VERIFICATION, GOOGLE SITE VERIFICATION, APPLE DOMAIN VERIFICATION, DOCUSIGN TEXT RECORDS, AND MORE.
How can you view text records for a domain if dig is not available?
WITH NSLOOKUP COMMAND
NSLOOKUP -TYPE=TXT EXAMPLE.COM
What is an SPF record in DNS?
EMAIL AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM THAT LISTS ALL SERVERS / IP ADDRESSES AUTHORIZED TO SEND EMAILS FOR THIS FQDM.
How does an SPF record help to prevent others from spoofing a domain?
THE MECHANISM IN PLACE ALLOWS EMAIL RECEIVERS TO VERIFY AUTHENTICITY OF THE EMAIL MESSAGE ASSOCIATED WITH A DOMAIN.
IF THE IP ADDRESS OF THE SENDING SERVER MATCHES ONE OF THE AUTHORIZED IP ADDRESSES LISTED IN THE SPF RECORD ON THE DNS SERVER, THE SPF CHECK  PASSES, OTHERWISE IF IT DOES NOT MATCH, THE CHECK FAILS AND IT IS A SPOOFED / UNAUTHORIZED EMAIL.
What is a DKIM record in DNS?
(DKIM) DOMAINKEYS IDENTIFIED MAIL - ANOTHER EMAIL AUTHENTICATION THAT USES CRYPTOGRAPHIC SIGNATURES. RECEIVING EMAIL SERVERS CAN USE PUBLIC KEY USED FOR DKIM VERIFICATION STORED IN TXT RECORD TO VALIDATE SIGNATURES.
OUTGOING MAIL IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DIGITAL SIGNATURE. YOU WILL SIGN A DOMAIN’S OUTGOING MAIL AND THE RECEIVING MAIL SERVER VALIDATES THE PUBLIC KEY WHICH IS ADDED TO A TEXT RECORD IN YOUR DNS SERVER.
How is the public key for a DKIM record stored in DNS?
THE PUBLIC KEY FOR A DKIM RECORD IS STORED IN A TXT RECORD ON A DNS SERVER.
How do you configure a DKIM record in a web-based front end?
IT IS SIMILAR TO THE TEXT BASED FRONT END, WHERE YOU HAVE AN EASY INTERFACE TO MAKE CHANGES OR ADD RECORDS.


IT CONTAINS INFORMATION LIKE THE HOSTNAME, THE CONTENT (PUBLIC KEY), AND TIME TO LIVE VALUES.


What is DMARC in DNS?
DMARC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING POLICIES FOR HOW TO HANDLE FAILED SPF AND DKIM AUTHENTICATIONS.
IT STANDS FOR DOMAIN-BASED MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION, REPORTING, AND CONFORMANCE.
IT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE SPF AND DKIM PROCESSES.
DMARC TAKES THE EXTRA STEP TO DETERMINE THE DISPOSITION THAT SHOULD BE USED WHEN SOMEONE RECEIVES A MESSAGE THAT CAN’T BE VALIDATED.
What can you specify in a DMARC record in DNS?
SOMETHING LIKE “IF A MESSAGE IS NOT VALIDATED, SIMPLY ACCEPT IT” OR “SEND IT TO SPAM FOLDER” OR “REJECT THE EMAIL ENTIRELY”.
How does DMARC work with SPF and DKIM?
(DMARC) DOMAIN-BASED MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION, REPORTING, AND CONFORMANCE - EMAIL VALIDATION PROTOCOL THAT COMBINES SPF AND DKIM FOR GREATER CONTROL AND VISIBILITY OVER EMAIL AUTHENTICATION AND DELIVERY. DOMAIN OWNERS CAN DEFINE DMARC POLICIES FOR HANDLING FAILED EMAIL AUTHENTICATION.
IT WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH SPF AND DKIM TO ENHANCE THE EMAIL AUTHENTICATION PROCESS BY PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK FOR HANDLING EMAIL MESSAGES.
IT CAN SPECIFY HOW TO HANDLE FAILED SPF AND/OR DKIM CHECKS WITH A POLICY.
IT CAN PERFORM ALIGNMENT CHECKS FOR BOTH SPF AND DKIM BY COMPARING THE DOMAINS FROM THE AUTHENTICATION AND SIGNATURES FROM SPF / DKIM WITH THE DOMAIN IN THE “FROM” HEADER.
IT CAN PERFORM DMARC EVALUATION FOR BOTH SPF AND/OR DKIM ALIGNMENT CHECKS AND THE AUTHENTICATION RESULTS.
IT CAN PERFORM DMARC ACTIONS THE RECEIVING MAIL SERVER CAN TAKE LIKE REJECT, SPAM, OR NONE.
IT CAN GENERATE REPORTS WITH DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE AUTHENTICATION RESULTS, DOMAIN ALIGNMENTS, AND MORE.
What can you do with the report generated by a DMARC record?
IDENTIFY AUTHENTICATION ISSUES, SPOOFING ATTEMPTS, IMPROVE EMAIL DELIVERABILITY, IDENTIFY THREATS / PHISHING ATTEMPTS, DETECT EMAIL DELIVERY ISSUES, VALIDATE ALIGNMENT CHECKS, IDENTIFY UNAUTHORIZED SENDERS (SPOOFING), AND MORE.

How does a mail server use a DMARC record?
IT USES A DMARC RECORD TO VALIDATE AUTHENTICITY OF INCOMING EMAILS AND ENFORCE POLICIES SPECIFIED BY THE DOMAIN OWNER.
RECEIVES EMAIL → QUERY DNS SYSTEM TO PERFORM DNS LOOKUP FOR DMARC RECORD → RETRIEVES DMARC RECORD AS DNS TXT RECORD → EVALUATE POLICIES SPECIFIED BY DMARC RECORD AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION LIKE NONE, QUARANTINE (SPAM), OR REJECT.
IT USES A DMARC RECORD TO PERFORM SPF AND DKIM VALIDATION AND ALIGNMENT CHECKS.
IT MAY USE THE RECORD TO DETERMINE WHERE TO SEND REPORTS.
How do you add a DMARC record in DNS?
TYPE IS TXT RECORD.
CONTENT CAN INCLUDE DMARC ACTION (WHAT TO DO WITH EMAIL MESSAGE) AND CAN INCLUDE WHERE TO SEND THE REPORT.
What does the DNS server have

IT CAN MAINTAIN A DATABASE OF RESOURCE RECORDS LIKE ‘A’, ‘AAAA’, MX, AND TXT RECORDS.
IT ACTS AS A RESOLVER TO FORWARD QUERIES TO OTHER DNS SERVERS TO RESOLVE DOMAIN NAMES.
IT MAY MANAGE DNS ZONES (RR, DOMAIN NAMES, WITHIN A ZONE).
FUNCTIONS AS A NAME SERVER RESPONDING TO QUERIES AND TRANSLATING THE DOMAIN NAME TO IP ADDRESSES.
IT CAN IMPLEMENT CACHING TO PREVENT QUERYING AUTHORITATIVE DNS SERVERS CONSTANTLY.
IT CAN FORWARD QUERIES IF THEY ARE NOT AUTHORITATIVE FOR THE REQUESTED DOMAIN NAME AND NOT THE RIGHT ZONE.
IT HAS SECURITY MECHANISMS.
IT CAN MAINTAIN LOGS OF QUERIES AND RESPONSES.
