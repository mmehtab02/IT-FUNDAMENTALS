19_SAS ON VLANs and VPNs
Self-Assessment Sheet


What is a LAN?
LOCAL AREA NETWORK - A GROUP OF DEVICES IN THE SAME BROADCAST DOMAIN.
Why might we want to segment a network into smaller pieces?
SECURITY REASONS.
LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BROADCASTS THAT MIGHT BE ON A NETWORK.
What are the inefficiencies of using multiple switches for a LAN?
PURCHASING, POWERING, CONFIGURING, MANAGING TWO SWITCHES WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND MORE EFFORT.
EMPTY INTERFACES ON THE SWITCHES THEREFORE NOT IN USE.
What is VLAN?
VIRTUAL LOCAL AREA NETWORK - GROUPING OF DEVICES IN DIFFERENT BROADCAST DOMAINS ON THE SAME SWITCH.


How does VLAN solve the inefficiencies of using multiple switches?
IT REMOVES THE NEED TO PURCHASE, MANAGE, CONFIGURE, WIRE MULTIPLE SWITCHES.
How can we make a LAN more efficient and cost-effective?
USE A SINGLE SWITCH AND LOGICALLY ASSOCIATE INTERFACES ON THE SWITCH TO DIFFERENT NETWORKS.
THIS WAY YOU DON’T NEED MULTIPLE SWITCHES AND YOU DON’T NEED TO MANAGE MULTIPLE PHYSICAL NETWORKS, IT CAN BE DONE ON ONE DEVICE.
How does VLAN provide separation between different networks?
IT CREATES A VIRTUAL LAN LOGICALLY INSTEAD OF PHYSICALLY.
YOU CAN ASSOCIATE DIFFERENT PORTS TO DIFFERENT LANS ON THE SAME SWITCH.
What are the advantages of using VLAN over multiple switches?
IT WILL BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE YOU DON’T NEED TO PURCHASE AND MANAGE MULTIPLE SWITCHES FOR DIFFERENT LANS.
THIS CAN BE DONE ON ONE SWITCH INTERFACE.
How does using a single switch with VLANs help to manage and lower costs for a LAN?
YOU DON’T NEED TO PURCHASE MULTIPLE SWITCHES.
YOU CAN MANAGE AND SETUP THE VLANS ON ONE SWITCH.
ANY ADMINISTRATION CAN BE DONE ON A SINGLE SWITCH RATHER THAN MULTIPLE SWITCHES.
What is a VPN and how does it work?
VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK - ENCRYPTED (PRIVATE) DATA TRAVERSING A PUBLIC NETWORK.
USUALLY A COMBINATION OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT ALLOWS US TO SECURELY SEND INFORMATION ACROSS A PUBLIC NETWORK LIKE THE INTERNET FOR EXAMPLE.
ANYONE IN THE MIDDLE CATCHING THIS INFORMATION WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE / UNDERSTAND THE CONVERSATION.
Everything sent over a VPN connection is automatically encrypted, making it unreadable if intercepted by anyone in the middle.
TRUE
What does a VPN look like on the desktop of an operating system?
IT CAN BE AN APPLICATION INSTALLED ON THE OPERATING SYSTEM OR THE OPERATING SYSTEM CAN COME INCLUDED WITH SOME TYPE OF VPN CLIENT.
THIS WILL BE AN INTERFACE TO ACCESS AND TURN ON / ENABLE VPN CAPABILITY.


The user can connect and disconnect from the VPN using this interface and may also have options to configure the VPN connection settings?
YES TRUE

Are VPNs typically hardware or software-based?
BOTH, BUT NOWADAYS YOU MAINLY WOULD FIND SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF VPNS.

THERE COULD BE SPECIALIZED CRYPTOGRAPHIC HARDWARE, SOFTWARE-BASED OPTIONS LIKE APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE BUILT INTO AN OPERATING SYSTEM.

What is the advantage of using a VPN in a coffee shop?
YOU CAN SECURELY USE THE WIFI EVEN IF THE WIRELESS NETWORK IN THAT COFFEE SHOP IS OPEN AND NOT ENCRYPTED.

How does the VPN concentrator handle incoming and outgoing data?
DATA SENT FROM YOUR LAPTOP IS ENCRYPTED UNTIL IT REACHES THE VPN CONCENTRATOR, WHICH DECRYPTS THIS INFORMATION AND SENDS IT INTO THE CORPORATE NETWORK.

ANY DEVICE SENDING INFORMATION TO YOUR LAPTOP WILL GO THROUGH THE VPN CONCENTRATOR, WHICH WILL ENCRYPT THAT DATA AND WHEN YOUR LAPTOP RECEIVES IT, YOUR LAPTOP WILL DECRYPT THAT DATA.

THIS IS DONE THROUGH ENCRYPTED TUNNELS.

Can VPN software be installed on operating systems?
YES

Most modern operating systems come included with some type of VPN client.
TRUE


What is a VPN concentrator?
AN ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION ACCESS DEVICE

A STANDALONE DEVICE OR INTEGRATED INTERFACE OF A FIREWALL/MULTI-USE DEVICE THAT ALLOWS US TO SECURELY SEND INFORMATION ACROSS A PUBLIC NETWORK.
ANY INFORMATION THAT IS SENT TO AND FROM YOUR DEVICE (LAPTOP) WILL GO THROUGH AN ENCRYPTION OR DECRYPTION PROCESS THROUGH THE VPN CONCENTRATOR.

The entire process of VPN data encryption happens behind the scenes and is automatic as soon as you enable the VPN software
TRUE
