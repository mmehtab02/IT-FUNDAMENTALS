DV500_47_SAS On Laser Printers
Self-Assessment Sheet
Q1. Laser Printers are commonly found in__________and ___________.
Ans. HOME, OFFICE

Q2. How does a laser printer work?
Ans: COMBINES HIGH VOLTAGES WITH POWDERED TONER, HEAT, AND PRESSURE TO CREATE OUTPUT ON A PRINTED PAGE

LASER, HIGH VOLTAGE, CHARGED IONS, POWDERED INK, HEAT, AND PAPER.

IT IS A COMPLEX DEVICE WITH MANY MOVING PARTS, REQUIRING ON-PRINTER MEMORY, BEING MESSY INSIDE.

Q3. What are the advantages of using a laser printer?
Ans: HIGH QUALITY OUTPUT, FAST PRINTING SPEEDS, PERFECT FOR AN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT.

Q4. What is responsible for producing the image on the sheet of paper?
Ans: IMAGING DRUM

Q5. What does the laser do?
Ans: WRITES / PAINTS OUTPUT IT WOULD LIKE TO APPEAR ON THE PAPER.
IT CREATES THE IMAGE AND PROVIDES IT TO THE DRUM.

Q6. What is the imaging drum?
Ans: COLOR PHOTOSENSITIVE DRUM INSIDE OF A LASER PRINTER.

TAKES IMAGE, PICKS UP TONER, TRANSFERS TONER TO PAPER WHERE IT IS EVENTUALLY FUSED AS THE FINAL OUTPUT.

IT CAN BE ITS OWN PART INSIDE OF THE PRINTER.

Q7. How do you replace an imaging drum?
Ans: REPLACE THE SINGLE COMPONENT (OR TONER & IMAGING DRUM).

IT IS USUALLY EASY TO ACCESS THEREFORE YOU CAN EXAMINE, CLEAN, REPLACE THE DRUM EASILY.

Q8. What if you are replacing toner cartridges?
Ans. IF THE DRUM IS INTEGRATED INTO YOUR TONER CARTRIDGE, WOULD BE REPLACING BOTH THE TONER CARTRIDGE AND THE IMAGING DRUM.

Q9. What is the purpose of a fuser assembly?
Ans: ONCE TONER IS TRANSFERRED FROM IMAGING DRUM TO PAPER, IT IS PERMANENTLY AFFIXED TO THE PAGE USING HEAT AND PRESSURE TO MELT THE PLASTIC TONER POWDER ONTO THE PRINTED PAGE.

Q10. What is the fuser assembly inside of a laser printer?
Ans: IN THE EXAMPLE, IT IS THE DARK BROWN DRUM INSIDE THE PIECE DEPICTED THAT ALLOWS FOR HEAT AND PRESSURE TO BE USED WITH TONER.

Q11. How can you easily replace the fuser assembly if there are any problems?
Ans: IN THE OTHER EXAMPLE, THERE ARE LITTLE HOOKS YOU CAN MANEUVER TO RELEASE THE ENTIRE FUSER ASSEMBLY AND REPLACE IF ANY PROBLEMS.

Q12. What colors are usually installed into a laser printer?
Ans: CYAN, YELLOW, MAGENTA, AND BLACK.

Q13. How are the colors from the individual cartridges combined into a single page?
Ans: THE TRANSFER BELT AND ROLLER ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING TONER FROM INDIVIDUAL COLORS AND COMBINING THEM INTO A SINGLE PAGE.

Q14. Colors are usually installed into the laser printer as ____________separate cartridges.
Ans. FOUR

Q15. What do each separate cartridge allow us?
Ans. IT ALLOWS YOU TO REMOVE AND REPLACE INDIVIDUAL CARTRIDGES.

IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO PULL EXACTLY THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF COLOR FROM THE INDIVIDUAL CARTRIDGE.

Q16. What is transferred onto the belt in the printer?
Ans: THE TONER / COLOR FROM THE CARTRIDGES.

Q17. How is a single page from the printer tray sent through the printing process?
Ans: THROUGH THE USE OF A PICKUP ROLLER. THIS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PICKING UP A SINGLE PAGE AND SENDING IT THROUGH.

Q18. What might be the problem if no pages are being picked up in a printer?
Ans: THE PICKUP ROLLER (NO PAGES, MULTIPLE PAGES). THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CLEAN / REPLACE DURING THE MAINTENANCE OF A LASER PRINTER.

Q19. What do you need to do if the pickup roller is worn down?
Ans: AS THE ROLLERS WEAR DOWN AND BECOME SMOOTHER OVERTIME WITH USE, YOU WILL NEED TO REPLACE THESE WITH A NEW SET OF ROLLERS TO BRING YOUR PRINTER BACK TO NORMAL OPERATION.

Q20. What do the pickup rollers do?
Ans: THEY WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH A SEPARATION PAD TO BE ABLE TO PULL THE TOP PAGE OFF OF THE PAPER TRAY.

Q21. What is the purpose of the separation pad?
Ans: IT HELPS PICK UP THE PAPER, AS WELL AS IT IS HELPFUL TO KEEP MULTIPLE PAGES FROM BEING SENT THROUGH THE PRINTER ALL AT ONCE.

Q22. How expensive is the separation pad?
Ans: THEY ARE NOT THAT EXPENSIVE (INEXPENSIVE). IT IS A COMMON PART TO REPLACE.

Q23. What is duplexing?
Ans: PRINTING ON BOTH SIDES OF A PAGE AS AN OUTPUT.
THIS IS A TWO STEP PROCESS.

Q24. Does duplexing require any human intervention?
Ans: NO, THIS HAPPENS INSIDE OF THE PRINTER ITSELF.

Q25. How does a printer configured for duplexing work?
Ans: IT PRINTS ON ONE SIDE OF THE PAGE, GOES THROUGH AN EXTRA STEP TO TURN THE PAGE OVER, AND THEN PRINTS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

Q26. What type of hardware is needed for duplex printing?
Ans: IT IS EITHER A BUILT IN PIECE OF HARDWARE INSIDE THE PRINTER THAT IS SHIPPED WITH IT, OR IT MAY BE AN OPTIONAL ADD-ON THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE.

Q27. How does the duplex assembly work?
Ans: THERE IS A METHOD OF FLIPPING THE PAPER OVER USING THIS ASSEMBLY THAT IS ON THE PAPER TRAY IN THE LASER PRINTER.

IF YOU CHECK THE DUPLEX OPTION DURING THE PRINTING PROCESS, IT WILL ENABLE DUPLEX MODE AND AUTOMATICALLY FLIP OVER THE PAPER AND PRINT ON BOTH SIDES USING THIS ASSEMBLY.

Q28. How does the duplex assembly work?
Ans: REPEAT QUESTION

Q29. What is used to provide a negative charge to the photosensitive drum during the charging phase?
Ans: A CORONA WIRE OR CHARGE ROLLER

Q30. What is the purpose of the negative charge?
Ans: IT CLEARS THE DRUM AND PREPARES IT FOR THE IMAGE THAT WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE LASER.

Q31. What happens during the exposing phase?
Ans: THE LASER BEGINS WRITING THE IMAGE TO THE PHOTOSENSITIVE DRUM, CREATING A POSITIVE CHARGE EVERYWHERE IT TOUCHES THE DRUM.

Q32. What is the purpose of the charging phase in the laser printer?
Ans: IT CLEARS THE DRUM AND PREPARES IT FOR THE IMAGE THAT WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE LASER.

Q33. What is phase six of the laser printing process?
Ans: FUSING PHASE

Q34. What is Step 7 of the printing process?
Ans: CLEANING PHASE - REMOVES ANY EXCESS TONER FROM THE DRUM.

Q35. What is the process of printing a single page on a printer?
Ans: THE PROCESS CYCLES THROUGH AGAIN AND THIS DRUM MAY ROTATE A NUMBER OF TIMES JUST TO PRINT A SINGLE PAGE ON THE PRINTER.
STEPS 2-7 MAY OCCUR MULTIPLE TIMES TO BE ABLE TO PRINT THAT SINGLE PAGE.

Q36. What is the first step in the laser printing process?
Ans: PROCESSING PHASE - IT SENDS DATA OF THE PAGE TO THE PRINTER MEMORY.

Q37. What is the fifth step in the printing process?
Ans: TRANSFERRING PHASE - TAKES THE TONER ON THE DRUM AND TRANSFERS IT TO THE PRINTED PAGE.

Q38. Which step is known as a fusing step and what it is?
Ans: STEP 6 - PAPER PASSES THROUGH THE FUSER WHICH IS GOING TO MELT THE TONER AND PERMANENTLY ATTACH IT TO THE PAPER.

Q39. What would be the final step in the printing process?
Ans: STEP 7 CLEANING PHASE.
STEPS 2-7 MAY OCCUR MULTIPLE TIMES.
WHEN THE PAGE IS COMPLETE, THE ENTIRE PROCESS RESETS AND THE NEXT PAGE THAT NEEDS TO PRINT STARTS WITH PHASE ONE AND BEGINS THE PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN.

Q40. How many total steps are there in the printing process?
Ans. 7 STEPS

Q41. Third step of the printing process is the ________stage.
Ans. EXPOSING

Q42. In which step we're writing a negative charge to the photosensitive drum?
Ans. STEP 2 - THE CHARGING PHASE.
__________________________________________________________
STEP 1 PROCESSING - BUILD THE ENTIRE PAGE IN MEMORY.
STEP 2 CHARGING - PREPARING THE DRUM WITH A NEGATIVE CHARGE.
STEP 3 EXPOSING - WRITE THE IMAGE WITH THE LASER.
STEP 4 DEVELOPING - ADD NEGATIVELY CHARGED TONER TO DRUM.
STEP 5 TRANSFERRING -MOVE TONER FROM DRUM TO PAPER.
STEP 6 FUSING - HEAT AND PRESSURE TO PERMANENTLY STICK TO PAPER.
STEP 7 CLEANING - REMOVE EXCESS TONER.
