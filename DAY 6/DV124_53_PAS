Self-Assessment Sheet
Q1. What is an Impact printer?
Ans: A PRINTER THAT PRESSES AGAINST A RIBBON TO MAKE A MARK ON THE PAPER TO CREATE AN OUTPUT.

Q2. _____________ is a type of impact printer.
Ans.. DOT-MATRIX PRINTER

Q3. How does a dot matrix printer work?
Ans. IT IMPACTS THE PAPER TO CREATE AN OUTPUT. THE PINS IN THE MATRIX ARE SEEN IN THE OUTPUT. IF YOU ZOOM IN YOU CAN SEE THE OUTPUT IS MADE UP OF VERY SMALL DOTS. EACH ONE OF THE DOTS IS A PART OF THE PRINTING MATRIX.

Q4. What is the advantage of using a dot matrix printer?
Ans: THEY ARE GOOD FOR MAKING MULTIPLE COPIES BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE CARBON PAPER AND MULTIPLE PAGES BEING PRINTED AT THE SAME TIME.

IT GIVES A RELATIVELY LOW COST PER PAGE COMPARED TO OTHER PRINTING OPTIONS BECAUSE THE ONLY THING NEEDED TO CREATE THE IMAGE ON THE PAGE IS THE INK ON THE RIBBON.

Q5. What is the downside to using a dot matrix printer?
Ans: THE PROCESS OF MAKING IMPACT AGAINST THE PAPER CREATES NOISE. IN SOME CASES THESE ARE LOUDER PRINTERS THAN ANY OTHER TYPE.

IT IS ALSO NOT THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION / QUALITY OUTPUT.

Q6. Why are dot matrix printers perfect if you’re making multiple copies?
Ans: THEY ARE GOOD FOR MAKING MULTIPLE COPIES BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE CARBON PAPER AND MULTIPLE PAGES BEING PRINTED AT THE SAME TIME.

IT GIVES A RELATIVELY LOW COST PER PAGE COMPARED TO OTHER PRINTING OPTIONS BECAUSE THE ONLY THING NEEDED TO CREATE THE IMAGE ON THE PAGE IS THE INK ON THE RIBBON.

Q7. What type of printer is a dot matrix printer?
Ans: AN IMPACT PRINTER.

Q8. What is the resolution of a dot matrix printer?
Ans: NOT THAT GREAT. IF YOU NEED A LOW COST PRINTER TO PROVIDE BASIC OUTPUT OF LETTERS AND NUMBERS, THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD CHOICE.

Q9. Is a dot matrix printer suitable for very graphical output?
Ans: NO

Q10. What is the purpose of the ribbon in a dot matrix printer?
Ans: IT CARRIES THE INK.

Q11. Why is the component containing the print head relatively large?
Ans: MOST OF THIS IS A HEAT SINK THAT DISSIPATES THE HEAT CREATED DURING THE PRINTING PROCESS.

THE PRINT HEAD ITSELF IS RELATIVELY SMALL.

Q12. How many pins are inside the print matrix?
Ans: 24 PINS

Q13. How wide are the pins inside the print matrix?
Ans: THE WIDTH OF A SINGLE CHARACTER.

Q14. What material is the ribbon made of?
Ans:.FABRIC

Q15. How do we get output on page?
Ans. THE PINS PRESS AGAINST THE RIBBON THAT CONTAINS THE INK AND PRESSES INTO THE PAGE, LEAVING MARKS / OUTPUT ON THE PRINTED PAGE.

Q16. What should one make sure of when swapping out printer ribbons?
Ans: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT MODEL. THE RIBBONS ARE PROPRIETARY TO A SPECIFIC PRINTER TYPE. MAKE SURE THE RIBBON OF PURCHASE IS DESIGNED TO MATCH THE MODEL OF THE PRINTER.

Q17. What is inside of a ribbon cartridge?
Ans: A FABRIC RIBBON, USUALLY ONE VERY LONG RIBBON CONSTANTLY CYCLING THROUGH THE PRINTING PROCESS. IT CONTAINS THE INK AS WELL.

Q18. Dot matrix printers commonly use a ____________to be able to pull the paper all the way through the printer.
Ans. TRACTOR FEED

Q19. How is the paper positioned in the printer?
Ans: THERE ARE HOLES ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE THAT ARE USED TO PULL THE PAPER.

THE PAPER ITSELF MAY HAVE PERFORATIONS BETWEEN THE PAGES SO YOU CAN SEPERATE THOSE PAGES ONCE YOU’RE PRINTING IS DONE.

SINCE THE PAPER IS A LONG PIECE WITH PERFORATIONS, WE USE THE TRACTOR FEED TO PULL THE PAPER THROUGH THE PRINTER AND CONTROL IT MUCH BETTER THAN SOMETHING LIKE FRICTION.

THE TRACTOR FEED GUIDES LIFT UP TO ALLOW YOU TO PLACE THE PAPER.

YOU WOULD HAVE TO LINE THESE UP SO THAT IT IS PERFECTLY STRAIGHT ACROSS BOTH OF THEM, THEN YOU CAN LOCK THE GUIDES IN PLACE.

Q20. What should you do after confirming the paper is installed properly?
Ans: PRESS THE PAPER FEED BUTTON AND IT WILL PULL THE PAPER THROUGH THE PRINTER AND PREPARE FOR THE NEXT PRINT.

Q21. What type of paper is commonly associated with mainframe printing?
Ans: GREEN BAR PAPER

Q22. What is the size of pages that are used in mainframe printing?
Ans. 11 INCHES HIGH BY 14 INCHES WIDTH
