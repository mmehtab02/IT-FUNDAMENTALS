Self-Assessment Sheet
Q1. What is a 3D printer?
Ans: A PRINTER THAT PRINTS A NEW STYLE OF PRINTING. YOU CAN CREATE AN ELECTRONIC MODEL THAT YOU PROVIDE TO THE PRINTER AND IT IS ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU AN OUTPUT YOU CAN HOLD IN YOUR HAND.

Q2. 3D printer that prints in ____________ dimensions.
Ans. THREE DIMENSIONS

Q3. We often refer to 3D printers as a ____________________.
Ans. ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING.

Q4. What do we do to create a 3D model?
Ans. WE CREATE LAYERS ON LAYERS TO CREATE THE MODEL AS A FINAL OUTPUT.

Q5. What is additive manufacturing?
Ans: THE PROCESS OF 3D PRINTING. INSTEAD OF STARTING WITH A PIECE OF METAL AND GRINDING DOWN TO A FINAL OUTPUT, WE USE ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING TO START WITH NOTHING AND ADD LAYERS UNTIL WE HAVE THE FINAL OUTPUT.

THIS ALLOWS US TO CREATE PROTOTYPES VERY RAPIDLY. WE BUILD THEM ON A SCREEN, THEN WE CREATE THEM WITH A 3D PRINTER TO SEE HOW THEY MIGHT LOOK IN REAL LIFE.

WE CAN BUILD IN LAYERS TO CREATE THE OBJECT AND NO MACHINING PROCESS IS REQUIRED. THE DESIGN AND CREATE IS RELATIVELY QUICK AND INEXPENSIVE.

Q6. What are 3D printers being used for?
Ans: TO QUICKLY CREATE OBJECTS. WE ARE USING THEM IN SPACE (THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION HAS A 3D PRINTER). WHEN THEY NEED TO CREATE A VERY SPECIALIZED PART INDIVIDUALS ON THE GROUND SET UP THE DESIGN OF THE PART AND IT CAN BE PRINTED ON THE SPACE STATION WITH THIS 3D PRINTER.

YOU CAN DEPLOY DESIGNS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD / SPACE.

Q7. What is a very common type of 3D printing?
Ans: FILAMENT PRINTING / FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING / FDM.

Q8. What does FDM stand for?
Ans. FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING

Q9. Explain filament printing?
Ans. WE ARE MELTING THE FILAMENT AND PLACING IT IN VERY FINE LAYERS TO CREATE THE 3D OBJECT. THE PRINT HEAD WILL USE THE FILAMENT TO PRINT ONE LAYER, MOVE UP A BIT, PRINT THE NEXT LAYER, AND SO ON.

Q10. What are the advantages of using this type of 3D printer?
Ans: IT HAS A VERY LARGE PRINT BED.

YOU CAN MANAGE THE FILAMENT VERY EASILY BECAUSE IT IS EASILY TRANSPORTABLE AND INSTALLABLE IN THE PRINTER.

IT DOESN’T MAKE MUCH OF A MESS BECAUSE OF THE LONG STRANDS OF HARD FILAMENT.

IT IS EASY TO DISPOSE OF BECAUSE YOU DON’T HAVE MUCH MESS LEFT OVER.

Q11. How does the filament printer create 3D objects?
Ans. THE FILAMENT IS ON THE BACKSIDE, THE COLOR CHOICE IS BLUE.
THE FILAMENT GOES ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THE PRINTER WHERE IT CONNECTS WITH THE PRINTHEAD. AS IT’S MELTED IT CREATES THE 3D OBJECT. IT CREATES LAYER BY LAYER.

Q12. How does an SLA printer differ from a filament printer?
Ans. IT TENDS TO BE SMOOTHER AND MORE FINELY DETAILED THAN FILAMENT PRINTERS.

Q13. What does an SLA printer stand for?
Ans. STEREOLITHOGRAPHY PRINTER

Q14. SLA Printer is often referred to as_____________.
Ans. A RESIN PRINTER OR SLA PRINTER.

Q15. How does SLA printers work?
Ans. IT WORKS IN REVERSE OF HOW A FILAMENT PRINTER WORKS.

RESIN IS HARDENED USING A LIGHT SOURCE (ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT / LASER).
THE LAYERS ARE ADDED TO THE BOTTOM.
THE PRINT HANDS FROM THE BUILD PLATFORM AT THE TOP WHICH GOES UP AND DOWN, HARDENING THE RESIN WITH THE LIGHT AND REMOVING EXCESS RESIN.

Q16. There’s __________that sits on the bottom of this SLA printer, and the object that you’re printing is attached to a ___________that moves up and down.
Ans. LIQUID RESIN, BUILD PLATFORM.

Q17. What is the biggest challenge with resin printing?
Ans: IT REVOLVES AROUND HOW YOU MANAGE THIS LIQUID RESIN.

Q18. You have to use_______________, so that you don’t injure yourself when working with the resin.
Ans.  PROTECTIVE GEAR

Q19. What should you do with leftover resin?
Ans: YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT TO A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FACILITY IN YOUR AREA.

Q20. What do we refer to as the large surface used for 3D printing?
Ans: A PRINT BED

Q21. _________________ is a flat surface, and it usually is either adhesive on the bottom with your filament printing or adhesive on the top, so that you’re able to connect it to the build platform with resin printing.
Ans. PRINT BED

Q22. What needs to be done to the print bed to ensure a successful print?
Ans: EVERYTHING ON THE PRINT BED NEEDS TO BE COMPLETELY LEVEL, CLEAN, AND ANYTHING THAT WE’RE PRINTING ON THIS NEEDS TO STAY COMPLETELY STILL DURING THE PRINTING PROCESS.

Q23. What is the print bed for filament printing?
Ans: THE ENTIRE SURFACE USED TO PRINT ON IS THE PRINT BED.

Q24. What is the print bed typically made of?
Ans: FLAT SURFACE ADHESIVE / STICKY OR SOMETHING THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE OBJECT TO MOVE.


Q25. Are there different options for print beds?
Ans: YES, YOU CAN FIND SOME THAT ARE VERY LARGE OR SOME THAT ARE MORE COMPACT.


Q26. What is the print bed in resin printing?
Ans: A VERY SMALL AREA AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINTER WHERE THE LIGHT IS ABLE TO HARDEN THE RESIN.
