DV500_45_SAS On Computer Power
Self-Assessment Sheet


Q1. Why should you disconnect from the power source when working on a computer? Ans: ALWAYS DISCONNECT FROM THE POWER SOURCE WHEN WORKING ON THAT DEVICE.

IT IS AN ELECTRICAL HAZARD AND THERE CAN BE PLENTY OF ISSUES ARISE SUCH AS FIRE, SMOKE, SHOCKS, AND SHORTING YOUR DEVICE COMPONENTS.

IT IS A SAFETY PRECAUTION.

Q2. What is a challenge you might have when working on electronic components?
Ans: EVEN CAPACITORS ON THE DEVICES MAY STORE CHARGES WHEN THE POWER IS DISCONNECTED SO IT MIGHT SHOCK YOU.

Q3. What should you never do when working with an electrical system?
Ans: NEVER CONNECT ANY PART OF YOUR BODY TO ANY PART OF IT. THERE’S A POSSIBILITY YOU CAN GET SHOCKED.

Q4. What type of power does a computer motherboard and components commonly use?
Ans: DIRECT CURRENT, OR DC POWER

Q5. Power sources are receiving________________________ from the power outlet.
Ans.  ALTERNATING CURRENT, OR AC POWER

Q6. How would you get the conversion  betweenAC & DC?
Ans. THROUGH THE POWER SUPPLY OF YOUR COMPUTER, WHICH CONVERTS AC INPUT TO PROVIDE DC OUTPUT.

Q7. What are the common voltages provided by power supplies?
Ans: 3.3V, 5V, AND 12V OF DC POWER.

Q8. One measurement that we use with power is an ______________.
Ans. AMPERE / AMP / A

Q9. What does an ampere measure?
Ans: THIS DESCRIBES THE RATE OF ELECTRONS THAT ARE PASSING BY A PARTICULAR POINT IN ONE SECOND.

IT CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH A WIRE. IF YOU HAVE A LARGER DIAMETER HOSE, YOU’RE ABLE TO SUPPORT LARGER NUMBER OF AMPS.

Q10. What is voltage?
Ans: ANOTHER IMPORTANT MEASUREMENT (VOLT / V)

IT REFERS TO HOW MUCH FORCE IS PUSHING THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE WIRE.

SIMILAR TO OPEN / CLOSE OF A FAUCET TO CONTROL CHANGE OF FLOW OF WATER.

Q11. What is a watt?
Ans: POWER SUPPLIES ON COMPUTERS OFTEN ARE RATED BY WATTS.

IT IS A MEASUREMENT OF REAL POWER USE FOR THAT POWER SYSTEM.

(W)

Q12. How would you calculate the number of watt used?
Ans. TAKE THE VOLTS, MULTIPLE IT BY AMPS, TO GET TOTAL NUMBER OF WATTS.

Q13. _______________ is the type of power that we are receiving from the outlet that’s in the wall.
Ans. AC POWER

Q14. Why do we commonly distribute power using alternating current?
Ans. AC POWER CAN BE SENT OVER VERY LONG DISTANCES.

Q15. What is the power of alternating current in the US and Canada?
Ans: 110 TO 120 VOLTS OF AC POWER.
(60 TIMES A SECOND ALTERNATING / 60 HERTZ)

Q16. What is the frequency of alternating current in Europe?
Ans: 220 TO 240 VOLTS OF AC POWER.

Q17.We often refer to the number of times this current alternates as a total number of _________________.
Ans. CYCLES / HERTZ

Q18. If alternating current is going into our power supply, then______________, is what is coming out of our power supply and onto the _________________.
Ans. DIRECT CURRENT / DC
MOTHERBOARD
Q19. What is the voltage and frequency for a power supply in the US?
Ans: 120 VOLTS AC / 60-HERTZ FREQUENCY

Q20. What is the voltage and frequency for a power supply in Europe?
Ans: 230 VOLTS AC / 50-HERTZ FREQUENCY

Q21. What should be done if a computer is moved from one country to another?
Ans: MAKE SURE THAT YOUR POWER SUPPLY CAN SUPPORT THE CHANGES IN VOLTAGE.

Q22. How can you determine the voltage of a wall outlet?
Ans: YOU CAN USE A MULTIMETER TO MEASURE IT.

Q23. What should you be careful of when using a manually switched power supply?
Ans: PLUGGING IN THE WRONG VOLT POWER SUPPLY (120V) INTO THE WRONG VOLT POWER SOURCE (230).

YOU WILL SEE SPARKS AND SMOKE COME FROM THAT POWER SUPPLY.

Q24. What is the purpose of the switch on the back of the power supply?
Ans: TO SWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT AC VOLTAGES.

Q25. What is the power supply used for?
Ans: IT CONVERTS AC CURRENT INTO DC CURRENT FOR YOUR DEVICE.

Q26. What is direct voltage?
Ans: TYPE OF ELECTRICAL VOLTAGE THAT MAINTAINS A CONSTANT DIRECTION OVER TIME. IT COULD BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE WITHOUT CHANGING ITS POLARITY.

DC VOLTAGE CURRENT OUTPUT FOR YOUR DEVICES.

Q27. What is a characteristic of direct voltage?
Ans: IT IS EITHER A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE VALUE.

Q28. What components typically require higher voltages?
Ans: HIGH VOLTAGES ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH COMPONENTS INSIDE YOUR SYSTEM THAT NEED ADDITIONAL POWER.

THINGS LIKE PCIe ADAPTERS, HARD DRIVE MOTORS, COOLING FANS MIGHT REQUIRE +12V TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE.

Q29. What voltage is usually used for modern motherboards?
Ans: +3.3V VOLTS

Q30. What components take advantage of the 3.3 volts on modern motherboards?
Ans: M.2 SLOTS, SOME RAM SLOTS, AND OTHER COMPONENTS.

Q31. What is the Standby voltage used for?
Ans: SOME POWER SUPPLIES ALSO HAVE A SEPERATE LINE FOR A +5 VOLTS SB.

THIS STANDBY IS USED WHEN YOUR SYSTEM IS IN A HIBERNATE MODE. IT SCOUTS FOR WHEN IT ENTERS SLEEP MODE, AND WHEN IT EXITS IT.

Q32. What type of components use negative 12 volts?
Ans. OLDER COMPONENTS LIKE AN INTEGRATED LAN CONNECTION, OR SOME OLDER SERIAL PORTS, OR SOME PCI CARDS.

Q33. Are modern motherboards designed to use minus 5 volts?
Ans. NO, THAT -5V IS FOR LEGACY SYSTEMS.
(ISA ADAPTERS)

Q34. Does the power supply support the 120 volts used in the US?
Ans. YES, IT RANGES FROM 100V TO 240V COVERING ALL LOCATIONS.

Q35. If you add up all of the DC voltage that’s supported by this power supply, it can support a total of __________.
Ans. 850 WATTS

Q36. We get power from the power supply to the motherboard through this very large ______________.
Ans. 24 PIN CONNECTOR

Q37. What type of connector is used in modern systems?
Ans: FULL 24 PINS OF MOTHERBOARD POWER

(OLDER / ORIGINAL ATX STANDARD WAS 20 PINS, 24 PIN WAS ADDED FOR PCI EXPRESS POWER)

(24-PIN CONNECTOR CAN CONNECT TO 20-PIN MOTHERBOARD, SOME CABLES ARE 20-PIN + 4-PIN)

Q38. How do you connect the power connector to the motherboard?
Ans: UNPLUG THE SYSTEM, CONNECT THE POWER CONNECTOR FROM THE POWER SUPPLY DIRECTLY INTO THE MOTHERBOARD.

SOME CONNECTORS WILL INCLUDE A CLIP SO WHEN YOU PUSH IT DOWN IT PUSHES IN PLACE AND LOCKS ITSELF DOWN.

Q39. What type of computers likely have a single power supply?
Ans: OUR COMPUTERS AT HOME / MOST GENERAL SIMPLE USE DEVICES.

Q40. What type of devices may have multiple power supplies?
Ans: DEVICES IN A DATA CENTER OR SERVERS MAY HAVE MULTIPLE POWER SUPPLIES.

Q41. How is the load shared between multiple power supplies?
Ans: IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PLUGGED IN AT THE SAME TIME, THEY WILL EVENLY DISTRIBUTE THE LOAD ACROSS THEM BOTH.

EACH IS CAPABLE OF HANDLING 100% OF THE LOAD EVEN IF NOT ALL ARE CONNECTED / IN USE.

Q42. How do you remove a power supply from a server?
Ans: HOT-SWAPPABLE - THERE’S A CLIP TO PUSH DOWN AND YOU CAN SLIDE OUT THE ENTIRE POWER SUPPLY AND SIMPLY REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE WITHOUT POWERING DOWN THE SERVER.

Q43. What type of connectors are typically found on the side of a power supply that goes to the motherboard?
Ans: THERE MAY BE A FIXED SET OF CONNECTORS THAT INCLUDE POWER FOR OTHER COMPONENTS ON YOUR SYSTEM BESIDES JUST THE MOTHERBOARD.

MAY HAVE TOO MANY CONNECTORS, MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH.

Q44. What is a modular power supply?
Ans: INSTEAD OF HAVING A CABLE PERMANENTLY ATTACHED TO THE POWER SUPPLY, YOU CAN DEVICE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL PLUG IN AND USE WITH AS FEW OR AS MANY CONNECTIONS AS YOU MIGHT NEED.

THIS REDUCES THE NUMBER OF WIRES IN YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU WILL HAVE BETTER AIRFLOW AS WELL.

THESE ARE A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE.

THERE ARE HYBRID VERSIONS OF FIXED / MODULAR POWER SUPPLIES AS WELL.

Q45. How do you balance the maximum capacity of a power supply?
Ans: YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH POWER YOU’RE GOING TO NEED FOR THAT SYSTEM. THE HIGHER IT IS (WATTS), THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT WILL BE.

Q46. Does having additional capacity in your power supply change the overall speed or efficiency of your computer?
Ans: NO

Q47. Can you purchase a power supply from any manufacturer?
Ans: YES, IT SHOULD FIT FINE IN YOUR COMPUTER CASE SINCE THE PHYSICAL SIZE OF THESE POWER SUPPLIES ARE STANDARDIZED.

THE ONLY TIME TO WORRY IS WHEN YOU ARE USING A VERY OLD SYSTEM OR A PROPRIETARY ONE.

Q48. What is the physical size of power supplies?
Ans: THEY ARE STANDARDIZED SIZES THAT WOULD FIT PROPERLY IN A CASE.

Q49. What is needed to determine the proper size for a power supply for a system?
Ans: YOU NEED TO PERFORM SOME CALCULATIONS BY DETERMINING THE WATTAGE YOU WOULD NEED FOR ALL COMPONENTS INSIDE YOUR SYSTEM : CPU, STORAGE DEVICES, VIDEO CARDS, ETC.

Q50. How do I calculate the wattage needed for my system?
Ans: YOU CAN USE WEBSITES THAT PROVIDE CALCULATORS TO HELP WITH THIS, OR YOU CAN CALCULATE THE WATTAGE MANUALLY.

CHECKING DOCUMENTATION FOR YOUR DEVICES / COMPONENTS WOULD BE USEFUL.

ONCE YOU CALCULATED AN ACCURATE NUMBER OF HOW MANY WATTS YOUR SYSTEM MIGHT NEED, PURCHASE A POWER SUPPLY WITH THAT. IT WOULD BE WISE TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER AS WELL SINCE IT WILL GIVE ROOM FOR FUTURE UPGRADES AND LET THE POWER SUPPLY RUN EFFICIENTLY.
